I love crashes. When the markets crash, that's when I get rich. Inflation is causing stress. The United States can pay any debt because we can always print money. If you print bonds in your own currency, what happens to the currency? When the currency collapses, the economy collapses. You have to be ready. What's your best investment that you've ever made? I wrote a book. Sold 45 million copies of it. Do you expect some sort of a stock market crash? And how can you get rich during the crash? To me, it's the game. I play Monopoly. Four greenhouses, red hotel, oil wells. There's so many options to get rich, but you've got to find the one that works for you. Do you see there being a huge issue with money printing and taking on debt within the economy? America loses two trillion a year. One of the richest countries in the world used to be called Rhodesia. The biggest financial disaster in history took place there because they kept printing money. The U.S. dollar's next. Robert, thank you so much for coming on the Ice Coffee Hour. You've really changed my life. I think you, when your book came out, I read it in high school, I think ninth grade, and it completely got me thinking about buying assets, not buying liabilities. That completely changed my perspective that from that point onwards, I just wanted to invest my money. And I think I wouldn't be here today if it were not for your book. I tell you, that's the greatest joy of my, I'm an old man now, you know. And when I started out about your age, all I could hear was, you're full of shit. You're full of shit. You know, I was saying saving money is stupid. Savers are losers. Your house is not an asset. And you should buy the stocks. I'm in the stock market. And I had to fight for my own survival mentally. So I meet young guys like you, you have more options. And that's the thing, is there's so many options to get rich, but you got to find the one that works for you. You know, so it's great. That makes me happiest. Thank you. Curious, how much debt do you have? One billion, two. Does that ever make you nervous? Are you ever worried about defaulting on the debt? Gets me as sexually stimulating. Now I'll tell you why, okay. You owe the bank $20 million and you can't pay it back. You got a problem. But you owe the bank a billion dollars and you can't pay it back. Still a problem. How do they give you a billion dollars? Real estate. So, but if you say that you owe me a billion dollars, that's your problem. You know, what if the bank sees that you're saying that or they like, you know, they'd be like, like, you know, they'd be like, okay, well, maybe we should stop lending this guy money. Is that just the reality of the situation? And everyone at that level knows that if you default, it's not your problem, but it's the bank's. Well, you have to learn the process you learn. You know, like I, the reason I wrote Rich Dad Poor Data, they don't teach us anything about money. And so when I was a kid, I was, Rich Dad taught me playing Monopoly. And he says, one of the first persons on your team is your banker. So this is in Hawaii, Waikiki. And I would go with him. I'm a kid, you know, going, and he'd be talking to his banker. So his banker understood his strategies, how he was doing things, never lied to him, and his financials. The average American doesn't have financials. If you don't have financials, you know, income statement, balance sheet statement, cash flow, which is what I wrote about Rich Dad Poor Dad, bank won't lend you any money. They give you a credit card. So you've got to play the game or speak the language of a banker. So as a young man, I sat there listening to Rich Dad talk to his banker. And then I go, holy mackerel. And his job was going to stretch from me. And I said, look, I just need another million. So a million. And my old man, Poor Dad, you know, he could, he can't even get a credit card. But you have to have a banker on your team. It's very, you know, business is a team sport. My accountant, my attorney, my banker, they're on my team. Why would you say your advice is so controversial? Why do people see it as something way out of the norm? And when I wrote Rich Dad Poor Dad came out in 97, I created my cashflow board game and nobody would buy it. So being an entrepreneur, I said, I better do something pretty quickly here. So I wrote Rich Dad Poor Dad in 97. And of course they all turned me down. So you know what you're talking about? I said, your house is not an asset. I caught hell for that one. And I said, savers are losers and the rich don't work for money. So those three statements in Rich Dad Poor Dad, I mean, I was catching hell from everywhere from that. I remember I was living not too far from here. And I'm on, first time I'm on local TV. And I said, your house is not an asset. I got attacked by a bunch of these older women, should I say. Our house is an asset. Yours may not be. But if you read Rich Dad Poor Dad, ask the city to find my cashflow. If cash is flowing into you, it's an asset. If cash is flowing out, it's a liability. It's called financial literacy. Can you read numbers? Can you speak the language of money? But most of no financial education so that these older women, they said, how dare you say that? And there are friends of mine. How dare you say that? It's not an asset. I said, ma'am, how much does this cost you a month? I don't care what you say. It's so ingrained. You have to buy a house. Look at most guys, the young sports stars, they make, you know, get a million dollar bonus. What do they buy first? The house. You know, it's so programmed into you. So how do you simply determine then what is good debt and what is bad debt? Debt that makes you rich and debt that makes you poor. Is there an interest rate though that you wouldn't pay? Like if they offer you debt at 20%, would that just be too much? I've taken debt. Depends on how tough the situation is. It's a game. I played Monopoly. Play Monopoly. Four greenhouses, 1031 Red Hotel. Most people never get past the first house. They only have no houses. To get to the second house, you get, you know, one house, you get $10. Second house, you get $20. Third house, you get $30. Fourth house, $40. Hotel 60. Well, it's a quantum leap from four houses to that hotel. I own hotels in town. I just play Monopoly. It's not that hard to do. What do you think is the biggest misconception people have about you? I'm a nice guy. No. They think you're a nice guy and you're not? I'm an a**hole. Why you shoot me? Really? Oh God. I'm a US Marine. Boy, you cross me. I f***** on you. I come with a cheap suit. Well, you've been nothing but a nice person to us. Well, because you guys are nice guys too. You know, but boy, don't you, you know, there's respect. You guys are very respectful. You understand this. You're a subject. You're successful at what you do. I was, I'm glad you brought that up because it's the last two Uber rides I had. I almost got into a fist fight with the driver. Why? They're lazy. This one Uber guy picks me up and goes, hey, you write that book? I said, yeah. I said, no, no, no. He goes, did you read it? He goes, nah, I don't have time. Tell me what I should do. He said that? He said, do you think I just get rich? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I said, look, I study all the time. Do you study? He goes, no, I'm busy working. So you're a poor working class guy. You should have him buy your audio book though. They could listen to it in the car. Yeah. You could have made a few dollars if you just upsold them your book right then and there. I don't have time for lazy people. Damn. I'm curious. I don't have time for lazy people. It's easier to be lazy than productive. Okay. There's a couple interesting things there, but I do want to lean into the idea that a lot of wealthy people share that in the beginning, you need to do a lot and think a little bit less. And then once you start making a lot of money and you have a lot of people under you or you're you're a high level operator, then you need to think more and do less. And more money is made from your decisions instead of the actual work that you're putting in. Do you think in the beginning that you should just continue and work hard? When do you start like really thinking about these things? The thing that happened for me was I went to military school. I got, I fucked at high school twice because I can't write. Imagine that. I'm an international bestselling writer, but it wasn't that I couldn't write. The teachers didn't like what I was writing. Those bastards. So I said, this school is a waste of time for me. I said, I want to be rich and you guys are poor. Why would I want to learn from poor people? My school teachers just gave me an F for that. So I got nominations to the Naval Academy, US Merch Marine Academy. I took Merch Marine Academy. My study was oil. You know how much money I made from oil? How much? Lots. It's cash flow. I drill in oil well. Oil well were produced for 40 years. So I'll invest, let's say $2 million in a partnership to drill for oil someplace in North Dakota or Texas. And that oil well pumps oil for 20 to 30 years and I pay no taxes. And a lot better than paying that stupid stock market. My point here is this. There's a million ways you can get rich as young guys like you find the way that works for you. You know, like Warren Buffett, I could never follow that guy. I personally don't like what Warren Buffett says, but he's successful at it. But I don't play the stock market. It's a waste of time for me. So I drill for oil and I get that. And then I buy apartment houses with my money from my oil. And I get them. The apartment houses throw cash flow every single month. And I have apartment houses because I use a hundred percent debt to finance the apartment houses so that I pay no taxes. It's only a game. It's sheer monopoly. Then I buy a hotel. Do you think the average person should be investing in stocks or who do you think should be investing in stocks? The best advice for the average person is don't be average. Get your ass. The stock market and the 401k is set up for losers. You want to be a loser? Get a 401k. Why do you not want to invest in stocks? Is that because of tax implications? Control. I'm an entrepreneur, not a fricking loser. I control the oil well. I control the apartment houses. I control the hotels. But isn't some of that dictated also by the city and the governance? A little bit. Yeah, sure. You got to play the game. The point here is most people are losers because they're lazy. America's too easy. When do you think it made the switch that people have become lazier over time? Good economy, debt. There's 200 million Americans on some kind of government welfare right now. That's almost half, over half the population. And they're all counting on what they call that stuff. Social security is bankrupt. America's bankrupt. America loses $2 trillion a year. So we collect, let's say, $5 trillion in taxes, but we spend $7 trillion in expenses. We spend more on debt than we do on weapons. And we're fighting a war in the Middle East. And we're fighting that place in Ukraine. We're going bust. We're bankrupt. So that's why I say to them, I don't save this. I always carry this around. Here's $10 and here's a 1964 coin. Which one do you want? This is 50 cents. This is $10. The average American goes for the 10 bucks. This is worth more because this is real money. This is fake. They go for fake money all day long. It's really, really sad. This in 10 years will be worth 20 of that, you know what I mean? Because they keep printing money. Why don't our schools teach us that? Because our school teachers are Marxists. They're Marxists. I mean, not bad people. They're just Marxists. I'm a capitalist. Okay. Big difference. Yeah. You would do great if you went on the street and you asked people, would you want $10 here or this 50 cent piece? And to see what people say. I do it all the time. They don't realize that that's silver. I do. They don't know the difference. How often do people take the silver? None. This is worth more. Okay. You say that they don't teach you this in school. I'm curious, why is this not a part of the curriculum? People always speculate they're keeping you poor. They want you to stay poor. They don't want you to understand investing, buying assets instead of buying liabilities. Who are these people that don't want you to become wealthy? Do you think they exist? I wrote a book called The Capitalist Manifesto. One of the first books I went to military school, the West Merchant Marine Academy. Our first book we had to read was The Communist Manifesto. I recommend everybody read The Communist Manifesto and you'll find out that most of your friends are communists. They believe in paying income tax and a whole bunch of other things. So I went to military school and read The Communist Manifesto and I was curious about that when I was 18 years old. Then I found out in 1930, Columbia University, the communist organization invited Marxist teachers from the Frankfurt School in Germany to come to Columbia's Teachers College to teach teachers, American teachers, Marxism. So our school system is Marxist. If you can understand that, I mean, what they told you to pay taxes. You know what Marx says? Taxation is essential for the spread of communism. They also said most school teachers are labor union people. What Marx said was workers of the world unite. When I read The Communist Manifesto, it's only a small little book, I went, my family's communist. They're good people, tell me wrong. You see them on the street, well, there's communists over there. But they pay taxes. I don't pay taxes. One of the hardest parts about money and building wealth is finding a way to invest consistently and passively. Most of us, we just swipe our cards at groceries, gas, restaurants, and at the end of the month, there's nothing set aside to invest. And that is exactly why we've partnered today with Gemini to showcase the Bitcoin credit card, the only instant Bitcoin rewards card. With this, every purchase you make earns Bitcoin back. That's at the 4% back on transportation, 3% on dining, 2% on groceries, and 1% on everything else. It's really one of the easiest ways to gain some exposure to Bitcoin. All you have to do is use your card like you would normally. And instead of earning airline points that constantly get devalued, you get to earn Bitcoin back instantly. There's also no market timing required. You're just investing as you spend. And to put it in perspective, Bitcoin rewards that are earned and held for one year on the Gemini credit card have appreciated 277% on average. Now, obviously crypto is volatile, but it shows just how powerful this can be when you're thinking long term. Plus, this card has no annual fee. So if you're interested, go to Gemini.com slash iced. And when you're approved and spend $3,000 in the first 90 days, they will give you $200 in Bitcoin. You could even check if you're eligible with no impact to your credit score. Just head to Gemini.com slash iced or use the link down below in the description to apply today and start earning instantly. Seriously, guys, this is a really powerful credit card with $0 in annual fees. If you want to earn the Bitcoin when you're spending your money and invest for the long term, I highly recommend it. See rates and fees in the description for more info. Thank you so much to Gemini for sponsoring this episode. How would the government run though, if they were not collecting taxes? Because there would have to be money coming from somewhere to pay for things like roads and city streetlights and things like this. Not my problem. No, I mean, they'll figure it out. I mean, I'm communist. They just extract your money from the top down. You know, Russia runs, they're communist. The point is people don't know they're educated by communists. I was at Arizona State University, it was the fourth largest schools in America. I was on stage with a guy named Charlie Kirk. They came after us because we were teaching capitalism. So if you understand that, I would say 80% of all school teachers are at the core Marxist. They just don't know it. They pay tax. They belong to the teacher union. What's the biggest union in America? The NEA, National Education Association, National Extortion Association. Our test scores are going down, teacher salaries going up. If the average person knows nothing about money, if you could go in and rewrite the school's curriculum to teach financial literacy and how to invest, what are the top two? I already did that. It's called rich dad, poor dad. What would you say? I already did that. I agree. I read rich dad. And that's why that lazy son of a Uber driver says, yeah, I got your book. I don't have time to read it. I said, the problem is they're lazy. They're hardworking, poor people. There's nothing wrong with being a hardworking, poor person. You guys had that guy on, I was talking to him about, he hung out with Richard Branson on Necker Island and all this. He says there's different kinds of poor and different kinds of rich. That was a great program you guys had. I sat there listening, so I went. So he says you can be poor, but you can be ultra poor also. And you can be rich, and you can be ultra rich. And this guy was, what was his name? He was- Sahil Bloom. He was talking about the optimal rich to be, because if you get ultra rich, you have to question are people around you because of what you have. But if you're rich, you have access to things without being over the top. Yeah. He was very good. You're a great program you guys had. So I listened to that. I learned a lot of it. That's coming on your show. I found out what you guys are about here. So you guys are into educating and illumination, basically, putting the light on a subject. But when he says this, some people, they get so rich, it ruins their lives. I don't have that problem. I like, because getting rich is a game to me. That's all it is. So where do people go wrong, where they get rich and it ruins their life? What makes you different, and how have you got about that? I think they sell their soul. We all have a soul. There's a price on it. And I just don't do that. You've said savers are losers. That's one of my favorite quotes of yours. I'm curious, when you say savers are losers, what is the average person, the person that doesn't have a lot of extra money at the end of the month supposed to do then? Save real. Silver today is 40, 45 bucks, I think. Yeah. Gold is $3,500. I started saving this when it was a dollar. I have boxes of silver, and I have boxes of gold. I own gold mines. I've taken two gold mines public, one on Toronto Stock Exchange, one on New York Stock Exchange. I believe in sound money. I don't work for this fake garbage, but that's what schools teach you to do. This is not money. This is called toilet paper, and they can print as much as they like of it. And it's killing us right now. It's killing this country. So I was just talking to you. I was in Zimbabwe last week. I was in Zimbabwe in 2002. You know, the guys may have seen him. He has 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollars. Everybody's laughing at Zimbabwe. So I was in Zimbabwe in 2002. I'm a hunter. I'm a politically incorrect hunter. So I'm out there in Zimbabwe. I'm looking at this stuff. And the next year, I went back again. The Zim dollar collapsed. And I'm in a truck, hunting truck, and these truckload full of black guys with AK-47s. They're called war vets. Why they call them that? I don't know. They came up there. They just went like this. All we can do is when the currency collapses, the economy collapsed. So that's why I say to Americans, in America, it's doing exactly the same thing Zimbabwe's doing now. We print money to pay our bills. There's no difference between a Zim dollar and a U.S. dollar. So I warn people all the time, don't save this. Save silver, Bitcoin, Ethereum. Go for something that's not printed by the U.S. government. Like I said, I don't have oil stocks, but I own oil wells. And every month, they pump oil. Guess what? They use it every month. Every month, they send me a check. And because I'm in a vital industry, oil, I pay no tax. My friends live in Vegas or Puerto Rico. I said, if you knew your tax law, you wouldn't have to live in Puerto Rico or Vegas. Because the tax laws are written for capitalists. If you're not a capitalist, you pay tax. HOFFMAN Do you invest in anything that you can't get depreciation on? Because I know with oil, you could depreciate it. Real estate, you could depreciate it. How do you decide where to allocate your money? And at what point do you buy something like Bitcoin or gold or silver? ZIMBABWE I'm always moving money. My problem is too much money. If you just buy assets, rich don't work for money, but the rich work for assets. So my first property, I was, it was 1974, getting out of the Marine Corps. I was a pilot. All my friends went on to become pilots for the pension. Guess what happened to all their pensions? Gone. They took all the pensions of the pilots, bunch of losers. But I'm not going to fall into that trap. This is 74. So I just, at that point, I took real estate courses, stock courses, technical trading. I go to seminars and you know what? I met a little seminars and goofy things like that around. I meet guys like you. That's where I met my friends. There were people that were actually interested in learning about money. And we became really good friends. And my best friend and I became billionaires. I met him at a seminar, you know, let's kick some ass. But if you hang out with losers and poor people, that's your choice. And they're probably good people, am I wrong? You know, like that Uber driver in his head. I'm quite sure he has a tape or a cassette playing. I'm a good working, hard working poor man. Unless he changes that tape, he's a hard working poor man. I said, have you read my book? He said, no, I don't have time. But he has time to drive an Uber. God bless him. I like Uber. You know, saves me from DWI drivers and all that stuff. You know, it's a great service. It's fantastic. But if a person doesn't change the tape up here, so that's why you read books and study and go to seminars and YouTube and what you guys are doing. Listen in. So at this point, where do you make most of your income from? Just property and oil. And I make a lot of money off of, I've been buying gold since I was a, not a kid, but you know, basically. So I just paid for my house. They wanted four and a half million for it. So I just took out some gold from my safe, paid for it. The gold only cost me 450,000. The house was 4.5 million, but because I saved gold coins, so I only paid 450 for the gold. But over the years it went to 4.5. So I paid for that. And then I only hang out with friends who are rich. I mean, I'm selective about that, but we just get along. We're always doing deals together. So my other friend is Kenny McElroy, one of the smartest real estate guys I know. You know, he's doing billboards now. I said, Kenny, what the heck are you doing in billboards? He says, bonus depreciation. So that means you put 100,000 to a billboard. You might get 5,500,000 depreciation. So by hanging out with smart guys, I get richer. And he and I, and Ken and I are always studying together. We get together on a regular basis and we study. So when I was with those two Uber drivers, I mean, they just pissed me off the other day. Well, I don't have time, man. Tell me what, tell me, tell me what I should do, you know. What percentage of people would you say have that mindset that they just don't have time? Lazy people. What percentage of the U.S.? I mean, 99, 95%. And what separates them from the 5%? That was your, that guy, who was that guy? Saw Hill Bloom. Everybody should listen to that. Yeah, link to that episode down below. Our episode was Saw Hill. Highly right. We just posted it. So it's a brand new episode. So chances are you probably haven't seen it yet. So go and see it. It's fantastic. Thank you. Because it's only a choice. Well, how much, people say, well, how much is enough? I don't think you get it. I go, what do you mean? See, they think money is about the dollar amount. To me, it's the game. I play Monopoly. Four greenhouses, red hotel, oil wells. It's just a game to me. It's not serious. What's your best investment that you've ever made? I wrote a book. Sold 45 million copies of it. That's the biggest asset I've ever made. How much did you make from the book? I don't know. I don't count. I have accountants do that shit for me. I'm always moving money. I'm always moving my money into the next thing. Next thing. So you can ask my friends, Kenny McElroy says, hey, when's that billboard deal coming together? Good, good, good. No, friend man, when's this property coming together? Good, good, good, good. I invest with other entrepreneurs. I don't invest on Wall Street. Have you ever lost money with an investment? And what's been your worst investment? My own company. But losing is part of winning. I think that's the thing that gets most people. Because most freaking school teachers tell you don't make mistakes. The reason school teachers are poor is you don't learn unless you make mistakes. I flew for the US Marine Corps. And as we got ready to fly into Vietnam, I was in Camp Pendleton getting ready to go. I flew the gunship. Every day we had to practice crashing three to five times a day. We practiced crashing. Because the odds are you're going to crash. So I went down three times in Vietnam. But every time the engine quit, I got so, you know, automatic. There's a book called The Big Print by Lawrence Lippard. Everybody should read The Big Print. It talks about traditional education versus military education. I went to military school. First one, first word we learned at military school, mission. What's your mission? So Lippard talks about in military school, you're always preparing for something to go wrong. That is very, very true. Whereas in traditional school, everything's sunshine and roses. In a perfect world, this will happen. But you cannot handle it. Like that first time I lost my engine. I tell you, it's terrifying. We're flying a strike into Vietnam. I think it's got 18 rockets on a machine, crew, boxes of ammo. We're all strapped in. We've got leather. We've got, you know, best. We're heavier. That engine quit. The reason pilots die is they pull back. What we're trained to do as Marine Corps pilots, when that engine quits, you push forward. They call out, look, you look at the eyes of death. So it's only about 1500 feet. When that engine quit, boom, nose forward, cut power. The team was already prepared. Rockets were being kicked out. Cannons were ammunition kicked out. That vest going off and all this, boom, into the water. I went over to Vietnam with 16 men, Lieutenant Kiyosaki. I came back with 16 men, all alive, all in one piece, because we prepare for bad times. Although really quick, I just want to say that when it comes to business, they say that you could have better, cheaper or faster, but you could only pick two.

What is the most important failure you've experienced? I was court-martialed twice. And you ever see that movie, A Few Good Men with Nicholson? It's been a long time. Yeah. He's Colonel Jessup because you can't handle the truth. So what I was doing, for some reason, I like pretty women. I just find them very attractive. I always got in trouble with my helicopter and pretty women. So I was in Hawaii, a station at Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station. I go into Waikiki, I had shaved, and back then everybody had long hair. So they knew you were a Marine right away and they spit on you. I came back from Vietnam, got hit with rotten eggs and spit on, called names, terrible coming back as a Marine, as a serviceman. And so we couldn't pick up any women. So I said, well, I got this thing called a helicopter. So I talked to these young women. I said, want to go for a helicopter ride to a private island? They go, some of them don't see your hair anymore. So I used to fly from Kaneohe Air Station to the Air Force Base next door and pick up the ladies and we fly to this private island loaded with beer. Drinking all night. We were partying, going for the mile high club, everything. And so I'm having the best time. And so everybody hears about my little ventures I'm doing. So my commanding officer says, can I go with you? Sure, sir. He's a colonel. I'm a lieutenant. And he goes, sure. So we go, we're partying away on this island, drunk as skunks and all this stuff. And one day I come taxiing back in to Oahu, the main island, and I shut my engine off and MPs are out. They opened the door of my helicopter. First thing that falls out is beer cans. So that's federal offense right there. Then I fell out. I had no flight suit on. I was in swimming trunks and rubber slippers. In the back they find cans of beer, diving gear, everything illegal. And the mistake I made was I started to lie. And so they caught me. They put me under house arrest. I had a nice condo and Mikey key. They put this Captain Abrams, nice Jewish attorney, prosecutor on my butt. Oh, he was good. I thought I was good. I'm trying to cover my, it was exactly like a few good men. They took the fuel logs. And so they were checking my fuel logs and all this stuff. And I was lying through my teeth. And finally, I was like, I couldn't stand it anymore. He caught everything I did this Abrams, great attorney. I mean, I respect him a lot. So I'm sitting in the room and he goes, so Lieutenant, on this day, did you do this? Sir, I'm going to tell you the truth, the whole truth, other than the truth. I tell him about every stupid thing I ever did. On this day, I flew women here. On this day, I did this here. This day, we did this here. And at the end of it, I think I lost 30 pounds because I was just so upset, you know, lying, tracking me down and all this stuff. I sat there like this and on the, on the stand, I looked up at Captain Abrams and I said, how many years, sir? And he smiled at me and says, you're free. Hmm. I said, what? Let's get the fuck out of here. Honorable discharge. Thank you, Marine. I said, what? He looked at me and he says, son, I'll tell you something. We all fuck up. We all make mistakes. Just don't lie. Because when you lie about your mistakes, you become a liar. That's the worst thing you can do. That was one of the best lessons I ever had. So to this day, I have tremendous respect for the US Marine Corps because they pounded me. And this Captain Abrams, man, he was one smart dude. I don't know how he caught all my, I mean, I was cheating every, I was on top of that, I was a top secret officer. So I have a lot of top secret files and all that. He tracked me down. And so when I saw a few good men with Nicholson and so Jessup Nicholson goes, you can't handle the truth. I said, that wasn't it. How did that change your mindset afterwards? Don't lie. You fuck up, you fuck up. God designed us to make mistakes. The way a baby learns to walk is to fall down. The way you learn to ride a bike is to fall down. We make mistakes. So God does, I'm not really religious, I'm not preaching here. The way humans were designed to learn is by making mistakes. So I'm an entrepreneur. I made a lot of mistakes, but that's why I'm rich today. And those Uber drivers didn't want to go through that process. You know, I crashed three times. I have a broken back because of it. But we practice making mistakes. And I think our academic system is screwed up because most school teachers sing from the Bible of don't make mistakes, because mistakes make you stupid. The facts are humans are designed to make mistakes. And that's how we learn. How has only ever being honest and telling the truth positively affected your life? We have Kevin O'Leary on this podcast a while ago. I'm sure you probably know who he is. He would say, He's a smart dude, boy. He is a smart guy. And he was saying the exact same thing that you're saying right now, which is one lie can destroy your life. Yeah, exactly. One lie. And so he has made a pledge to only ever be honest. And that's part of why he is the way that he is. He's known as Mr. Wonderful because he's so blunt and cut and dry and honest. Yep. He only says the truth and he credits that towards his, I would say, understanding that you should only ever be honest and never lie. Yeah, we all make mistakes. That's how I lost so many companies. We make mistakes, but don't lie about it. So I've paid my bills. I've lost several million dollars. I paid it off. But that's why I'm rich today. But those Uber drivers didn't want to go through that process. They want, what's the quick fix? I said, buy Bitcoin. So I can't afford it. It's got a problem. Bitcoin is brilliant, by the way. I think it's really been ether. Ethereum? Ethereum. Fantastic. You don't have to be that smart and you get rich. Yeah. A lot of people compare real estate with Bitcoin. They say, well, I'm going to be rich. A lot of people compare real estate with Bitcoin. They say Bitcoin is like a digital real estate in a sense that you're buying something that's fixed. What is your thought on real estate? Real estate's a tough game. Do you think that prices for real estate are elevated to a point where it just no longer makes sense to buy? It doesn't make any difference to me. If it's too expensive, you don't buy it. Yeah. I love crashes. When the markets crash, that's when I get rich. Everything goes on sale. So people have all wanted it. Today, as it was September 2025, the S&P is at all-time highs. I'd be out because I only got one more direction down. Do you expect a crash in the near future and how do you get rich during a crash? Well, that's what I was talking about, talking about Zimbabwe when I was there. When I saw that crash, I said, this is great. The sad thing, what happened in Zimbabwe, was I was talking to this young entrepreneur about your age. He lost his nerve. I could tell he was smart. I said, you live in one of the richest, Zimbabwe's one of the richest countries. It's a gold country. Man, there's so many gold mines here and all this. I'd be out like a cheap suit. He lost his nerve. I've seen it happen. When a pilot loses their nerve, we take them off the line. They can't handle it. They just can't handle it. I mean, people is tough. When I was flying into combat, we just put rock and roll music on, because we had to jack ourselves up. When you see your friends go down and you never see them again, it just takes your heart out. Your friends don't come back to the carrier, going to cry. But the next day, you're going to strap in and going back at it again. That's what I loved about the military. It was mission first. You didn't count. So I meet young men, especially, though. Where's your testicles? Get up there and fight hard. But they don't do that to men. My friends who are now generals and things like this, they can't fight men. The Marine Corps had a tough time fighting men. So on the topic of a possible incoming crash, do you expect some sort of a stock market crash? How can you get rich during the crash? Everything goes on sale. I don't save dollars. I only serve gold and silver and Bitcoin and Ethereum. I don't save this stuff. So in a crash, gold, silver and all that, what they do is they print more money. When they print more money, those go up in value. So my gold goes up, silver goes up, Ethereum goes up, Bitcoin goes up. So you've got to know in a crash, this goes up, crashes goes down. It's the same as flying an aircraft. So I like crashes. The reason I'm in Phoenix, Arizona is in 2008 when it crashed here, the best real estate on earth went on sale. I bought so much. It was incredible. The banks were happy to see you. There's this belief now though that we're not going to see a crash anymore. If we see the markets drop, the Fed can come in and just print more money and bail us out. How does it change your investing philosophy? Because when you print money, the rich get richer and the poor middle class get poorer. The reason we have homelessness today is because we have a Federal Reserve Bank. It's a criminal organization. Anything that's a central bank is Marxist. So the Fed is Marxist, if you understand that. So Thomas Jefferson said, if we allow somebody to take over our money, which the Fed did, people wake up homeless in their own lands. Look at homelessness is exploding. People can't afford homes. Your age is having a tougher time because prices are so high. When you print fake money, which this stuff is, you make life harder on people. But guys like me who have assets, you print this, this goes up. But if you print this, the price of coffee also goes up. So inflation is going to wipe out my generation. The boomers don't have enough money to get through inflation. The boomers are going to be homeless all over the place. HOFFMAN What about the argument that AI is going to help bring down the cost of a lot of items and that we might not see as much inflation over time because we could start doing things for less? BELLAMY Yeah, that's going to cause unemployment. So what happened was the industrial age took out the manual worker. Look at the guy who worked with his hands. AI is going to take out the doctors and lawyers. I don't need a lawyer anymore. AI does it for me. So you're going to sew. This can be good and bad to it. But I don't really give a crap. If you understand money, that the way the Fed operates, which is a Marxist organization, they're going to print. Like I said, I was in Zimbabwe. They printed to solve their problems. And they kept printing and it collapsed. I went to watch how they couldn't trade because this was the Zimdala was worthless. So I'm in Harare, not Zimbabwe. And then there's a thing called United Nations. And at the back of this garage, all these people were coming together. It was like a big swap meet because the money was no good. They're saying, I got this for sale here. I'll trade you my watch. I got some tomatoes for sale here. And they went to a barter economy that fast. So when I tell you guys I was in Zimbabwe, Africa goes, where's Zimbabwe? But America is following Zimbabwe right now. So you better prepare for it. What Zimbabwe did was they printed money to pay their bills. We print two trillion a year. That's why Trump is trying to stop. But there's people who will take them out for that. Do you think for the average person, given what you've just said, should buy or rent a house? It's an expense to me. It's all it is. The problem is if you don't make enough money, like that Uber driver, those two of them, rent in a row. I don't have time to read your book. So thank you. Bye. But if the average person needs to live somewhere and they say they're going to print more money, there is the belief that real estate as a result of that is probably worth more. Don't ask what if questions. Look, I own 1,500 rental properties. I'll just go sleep in one of them. How many guys do you own? Seven. So just keep buying. No, it's a serious... Thomas Jefferson said if a central bank takes over, which the Fed is, people wake up homeless in their own lands. And that's what's happening today. I look at the people who are homeless. Now you can say, well, they're on drugs or mentally deranged and all this stuff, which is probably true. But it's getting harder. When you print money, the rich get richer and the poor and middle class get poorer. So if you own a house and you print money, you feel, oh, my price of my house went up. But the average person's for the price of chicken and eggs and yogurt goes up and inflation wipes them out. So mark my words, on the first of the boomers, we're going to get wiped out via inflation. Your mommy and daddy may be on the street because inflation is going to wipe out the social security. When's the last time that you were wrong about a prediction that you had made? Never. Never wrong. As long as they're printing money, you can predict what's going to happen. It's happened throughout time. The Romans did it. The Chinese did it. Hitler did it. They all do it. What are your price targets for something like Bitcoin, gold, silver? I have no price target. I have an entry and I don't sell. So like right now, to me, the biggest bargain is silver. So silver is about 40, 50 bucks. And Ethereum, I think, is very good right now. I stopped buying Bitcoin. Why? Too high. I've seen so many predictions that Bitcoin is going to hit a million, five million. So if it's too high, why not sell? I don't need the money. I don't need money. I get 1500 rental properties. I own oil wells. Money keeps pouring in. I got to keep moving my money around. I invest in assets. Let me give you the three rules of rich dad poor dad. The rich don't work for money. The rich work to acquire assets. And assets, and that puts money in your pocket, whether you work or not. My little oil wells, I'm investing in billboards now. And the billboards are going to be outside Las Vegas. And they pay you every month, they pay you money for those billboards. And I get bonus depreciation. So I'm always moving my money. What's the ROI of a billboard? What's the ROI? I have no idea right now. It's just being put together now. It's bonus depreciation. So I put a million dollars in, I get five million depreciation. That means I don't pay tax. What would you say is the worst financial advice you've ever heard? Warren Buffett was for average people. Smart man. I listen to him, I go. So we actually have a video I'd love for you to react to. Warren Buffett speaks for the average man. And my saying to you guys is don't be average. You want to be the best at what you can do. I want to get your thoughts on what Warren Buffett said on leverage. This is what he said. They risked what they did have and did need. And that's foolish. That is just plain foolish. I don't make any sense what your IQ is. If you risk something that is important to you, for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense. I don't care whether the odds are 100 to 1 that you succeed or 1,000 to 1 that you succeed. If you hand me a billboard with 1,000 chambers, a million chambers in it, and there's a bullet in one chamber, and you said put it up to your temple, how much do you want to be paid to pull it once? So that's on leverage. That's why take a risk in anything if you don't need the extra money. What was he talking about? He has the biggest leverage of all. He has an insurance company. That's massive leverage. The reason you own insurance companies is because insurance companies have to keep placing their money. You want to get rich, you buy an insurance company. He's foolish. He's a smart guy in his field. My whole message to everybody is this. Find out the best field for you. For me, it's real estate and oil. I'm very good in those two fields, and now billboards. I love gold and silver. I have a gold mine in Utah. I took it public on the New York Stock Exchange. So one of my goals was to list a company on the New York Stock Exchange. So that's what entrepreneurs do. Our goals are different. The average guy says, oh, I think I'll have a ball diversified program 401K. That's not my goal. It takes no intelligence in a 401K. To me, it's a waste of time. I can beat the 401K all the time. I'd rather have oil wells that pay me every single month. Guess what? Every month, they're going to burn that oil. Every month. And every month, because they're burning that oil, I get a depletion allowance, which means I pay less tax. So I make more money and I pay less tax. To me, that's smart. To put my money in a 401K, I'm also giving it to Warren Buffett. Nothing wrong with that. Buffett's a smart boy, but his thing on leverage, he's talking about the average guy, yet he bought an insurance company. I think it was Geico or something like that. Insurance companies are the biggest leverage of his because they have to leverage their money. If you can put $200 in, they have to be able to pay you your money back later on. So he doesn't tell the whole story. He called gold rat droppings or something like that. That was, I think, Bitcoin. He called Bitcoin rat droppings. Bitcoin rat droppings. He's entitled to his opinion. Fine. But each of us has to find the way that makes the most sense to them. I like Bitcoin. I like Ethereum. I like gold. I like silver. I like real estate. I like oil. I don't like stocks. If you like stocks, invest in them, but be good at it. You've got to be very, very good at it. Most important thing, don't lie. You make a mistake. Mistakes are very good ways to learn. Oh, I screwed up here. People who lie about their mistakes don't learn. When it comes to investing in stocks, what do you think about investing in index funds or ETFs? I don't do that shit for losers. My opinion. But if you're a loser, have a good time. Graham's a loser. I like index funds. You got me wrong. It's not exciting. It's boring. That's why I like it though. Because I don't have to think. It fits you. Because here's the thing. When you're talking about owning all these rental properties and billboards, to me, that just seems like mental energy that gets tied up. And again, you've said do what works for you. And when I think about something like my rental properties, I can't stand them. Because when something gets fixed, I look at the bill and I think, how could I have done this for less money? Is this a good bill? I start itemizing every little thing and thinking. You're missing property management. I have a property manager. Yeah, I don't do that shit. So here's what bothered me. I don't do that shit, okay? I'm not a laborer. But how do you know that you're not getting ripped off? Because I have good property managers. Kenny McElroy is my partner. You should read his stuff. We've been told by a few people we should have him on the show. Yes. The man is a freaking genius. I mean, the thing I love about Kenny, he's funny. But he's one of the smartest entrepreneurs I have ever met. So when I have a question, I talk to him. The same as my tax guy, Tom Wheelwright, tax-free wealth, interview him. I want to find out oil. It's my friend Mike Maselli. So I just want the cash flow. I don't want capital gains. I don't want that. I want cash flow. I want as much debt as I can get. And I don't want to pay taxes. That's my game. Yeah, I think when it comes to me in real estate, though, I'll give you the refrigerator example because it still bothers me after a few months. I had a refrigerator ice maker just like this that broke. And so the tenant called the property manager. The property manager sends me a bill. And I see the bill. And it's already paid, already done. But it was $1,200. And the refrigerator was worth $700. And so I said we spent $1,200 to save a $700 refrigerator. That doesn't make sense. Where did we go wrong on this? And that little discrepancy took my focus away from doing anything else that would have yielded a higher return than me focusing on the refrigerator. And you could say, don't worry about it. It doesn't matter in the big picture. It really doesn't. But stuff like that, I can't help it. It's just how my mind works to optimize every little thing. And so the less I have on my plate and the more I could just focus on doing something like this, that gets a way better ROI than that refrigerator or the property. That's the way I think of things. So I just want to outsource and just index. Okay, I will say the mentality of I can't help the way that I believe like that my mind is going to react that way is a complete cop out. You absolutely can. So you can choose at any given moment to feel however you want to feel. You could choose right now to be like, okay, I'm never going to think about that again. So that's a cop out. I just want to say that. I'm not going to let you say that. I'm just the type of guy to get really upset when something happens. You can choose to not be upset. That's fair. I agree with that. You're looking at the property management side. I look at real estate, the finance side. So who else is going to lend me? Like I borrowed, how much did I borrow last week? Oh, 25 million. Who's going to give me 25 million to buy the S&P? But real estate, they do. Debt is the way I get rich. So Buffett saying debt is no good. That's Buffett's plan. This is a great program because what we're saying is find the way that works for you. You're fighting with a refrigerator. I'd rather get $25 million in cash to buy the damn place and hire a property manager. Speaking of debt, I would love to hear your opinion on this. We had Dave Ramsey on this podcast and I asked him a question. I want to hear your thoughts on his response. If you could borrow $1 billion, 0% interest for 10 years, would you do it? No. Even though you could put it in treasuries after the 10 years, you could lock in 10 year treasury right now, 5%. It's not worth it. I don't borrow money. There we go. What do you think about that? That's Dave Ramsey's formula. Unfortunately, he's really short-sighted. What he doesn't understand is in 1971, the US dollar became debt. If you stop borrowing money, the US economy stops. So he says live debt free. It's actually unpatriotic. I borrow money as a patriot because when I borrow money, I create money. Money only comes into existence after 1971 when we borrow money. But it's his formula. He and I have gone around and around on this. Live debt free. Although really quick, if you're looking to cut back on expenses without really changing your lifestyle, looking at your phone bill is one of the best places to start. Most people are still paying 60, 80, or even $100 or more for something they barely even think about. That's why we're excited to be partnering with today's sponsor, Helium Mobile, because they're doing phone service completely different. I kid you not, Helium has a plan that is literally $0 per month. It gives you 3 gigabytes of data, 100 minutes of calls, and 300 texts, no contract, no credit card, and yes, it actually works. It's absolutely perfect if you're just a light user or you want a cheap second phone line. And with the zero plan, you'll also earn cloud points. Think like credit card or airline points, but literally just for using your phone. You could redeem those cloud points for gift cards to places like Amazon, Apple, Target, Starbucks, and more, right from the Helium Mobile app. It's one more way that Helium helps you save and earn at the exact same time. They also just launched the Sprout plan made specifically for kids for just $5 per month. Your kid can get their own line, you monitor their usage, and you can even manage how they spend their rewards within the app. And if you need more data, they've got the Air Plan for just $15 a month for 10 gigabytes, or the Infinity Plan at $30 a month for unlimited. Still way cheaper than other carriers. So guys, we've left a link down below in the description to try Helium Mobile today. Just make sure to use the code coffee to get $10 in cloud points, which can be redeemed for gift cards to your favorite brands after 90 days. Once again, guys, there's a link down below in the description. Thank you so much to Helium Mobile for sponsoring this episode. Although really quick, let's be real.

And now let's get back to the podcast. Have you ever spent time with Dave? Oh, I had dinner with him one night and I said, how do you think this guy pays for this building? He says, debt, debt, 1970 when the dollar became debt. So just understand that. So in my point of view, when I'm borrowing money, I'm creating money. Do you think there's any peace of mind that you have owning a paid off house? No debt, no credit cards, everything you buy is yours. Yeah, but that doesn't make me peace of mind. I like my game. I like buying something as big as I can using as other people's money as much as I can. It's my game. Don't do what I do. I like my game. When I came out of the Marine Corps, I had to learn several things. I had to take sales courses. So my rich dad says, if you can't sell, you can't be an entrepreneur. Then after that was how to raise capital, debt. And that's when I found out he says, you better get to know your banker. And so I plan my future by what I did every day. I don't just jump into it. So I got to know my banker fairly well. Then I got to know my accountants and then some I like, some I didn't like. So today we have the rich dad advisor team, my accountants, Tom, we all write, I ask all of them to write books to tell people what they do for me. My accountant on the corporate side is Garrett Sutton because I use corporations to shield my, protect my wealth, but also limit taxes. So I don't, I don't come into this just guessing. Do you think money buys happiness? That you become happier the more money you have? I do. Is there- Have you ever been poor? I wouldn't say poor, poor, but definitely growing up, things were paycheck to paycheck. Yeah. It's not happy. I buy like I want to buy. At what point do you think money slows down? If you sell your value system, your soul, you're doing what you hate to do. I love what I do. Like I went back to Zimbabwe to teach. I work for free. I don't need money. I have so much money coming in. I can work for free. I would hate it if I couldn't go back to Zimbabwe and have to charge them money. I work for free because I have so much money coming in from assets, not from a job. Have you seen many people sell their soul? And when they do, what is that? Every day it's called the go to work. It's on the highway every morning. Yeah. I don't disagree with you. I remember I went to a doctor's appointment recently and I went right out for lunch. And so I'm watching some of these doctors assistants coming in and they say, oh man, it was Friday. They said only four more hours until we could get off work. What are you doing this weekend? They're all talking. And I remembered briefly, I was working like this nine to five job doing data entry when I was 18. And I remember that same feeling where you would dread Sunday because you had to go to work on Monday morning. And I remember thinking on Fridays, oh great, one more day left, only three hours to lunch. And then after lunch, oh great, only three hours left until I'm off. I'd be so happy on Friday. Then Saturday, I would think to myself, oh man, Sunday, I have to go to bed early because Monday I have work. And I remember just thinking, I never wanted to experience that ever. Yeah. I've thought about that a lot too. Yeah. And I have my best friend who he and I both became billionaires together. And he taught me a very valuable lesson. He says, you start work on Sunday. I went, what? He just reframed it. So we'd go into, we worked at Xerox together and all a little. We'd go to work and get our own key. We'd do all of our work on Sunday night because we got more done. And we submitted our proposals Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We had Friday, Saturday, Sunday off. What do you think is the best use of spending money that you found? Education. Like I said, I'm, you know, I got one of the benefits of my job is people want me to come and speak for them. So I get to go, oh, I can attend a seminar. And I get to hang out with some really smart people, you know, in the, in the green room. That's how I met Trump. Yeah. You know, Trump and I hang out in the back room going, and he goes, who are you? And I was, and we just, and he's, he's the best guy. He and his sons, Don Jr. and Eric, man, they're good kids, you know. And we became best of friends sitting in the back room together. When was this? Oh, years ago now. What was your first impression of him? I think the same as everybody else is kind of a, a presence. You know, he's, I mean, he exudes power. He is a very powerful man. Don Jr. and Eric, Eric Trump were hunters. And we go, this is private island, they used to take women to in Hawaii. We do it legally this time. And we fly there. We have no toilets, no running water. Those young boys ask no quarter. They're extremely well-raised young men. I can, you know, if I had sons, they would be like those two guys. They're the best, tough, mean, not mean, but strong, strong men. What have you learned from Trump? That's a good question. Just, I can call him. He's very accessible. How often have you called him? Very rarely. And when you do, what do you ask? Well, generally I say, where's Don and Eric? We're going hunting together. It's just fun. We're just friends. We wrote two books together. And we'd write and as he'd say, so I got to understand how he thought, he has a problem, you know, and the book, the book was called The Midas Touch, How Entrepreneurs, Why Some Entrepreneurs Get Rich. So I had to sit with, so how would you do this? And he's most generous, very generous man. His whole staff in New York City, just the best people. There was Rona and Meredith and all this, his bodyguard Keith. He and I had the body, just a great, just really good people. They're not arrogant. They're not cocky. That was the most surprising thing about hanging out with them. How do you think Trump raised such strong children? They said that, I asked that question. Yeah. Said their mother kicked their ass. Now, and they had a sister, you know, certainly in Vano, you know. They're just good kids, just really solid young men. Really, really solid. I mean, you're sitting off there, there's no toilet. You know, they do a whole, we had to eat what we killed and they don't, they don't, they're wimps. They're just solid, good guys. What was your last conversation with Trump like? It was, we were supposed to write a third book together. And I said, he says, Robert, can't do the book deal with you. Can't let me out of it. We have three book deal. I said, sure, you're out. Why am I going to hold it? Yeah. What are you doing? He says, I'm running for president. I said, good luck. That's all I could say to him. The next thing you know, he's coming down the stairs, you know. Would you ever want to be president? No. That's a, he's, you know, the other guy, Jordan Peterson. Yeah. We've had him on the podcast. He's a, man, he's a smart dude, Jordan is, but that's, I got to hang out with those guys in green rooms. So I was hanging out with Jordan Peterson and all this stuff. And he was talking about Trump, you know, and Jordan, as I was saying, he says, you think tough men are bad, weak men are the worst, something like that. Jordan says something like that. And so he says, Trump is a strong man. That's what we needed this time. Could you imagine if Kamala had won or Joe Biden's crime family? My God. So we needed a tough man at this time. I know people hate him. My family hates him, but he's a tough man right now. How do you think politics affect the average person when it comes to their money? Well, they pay taxes. That's true. No, I mean, it's, to me, it's really simple. To me, it's really simple. I was in Zimbabwe last week. They went bust because they printed money to pay their bills. The United States, it was at 36 trillion in debt. 37 now. It's almost 38. And we had 200 million, 350 Americans, 200 million are on some kind of governments of subsistence. And my whole family, not all of them, their idea of a good job is getting a government pension. So it's in your value system. I don't want a government pension, but there's so many of our school teachers, they want that government pension. And that's the 200 million that are part of this social security disaster we have coming. And so I saw young people like you, you know, study in Zimbabwe, 2002. I had my hands up like this. Law and order breaks. Law and order broke down. If you were the average person, let's just call them in their 20s today, and you were starting from zero, what would you do? I learned how to sell. You know, I like network marketing. I tell people to join network marketing. So why is that? Because you learn to take rejection. You know, if you can't take rejection, you can't be an entrepreneur. It's probably the, you know, everybody likes to be liked. I like to be liked. But man, you can handle rejection, you got it made. So network marketing, the guys I hang out with, they're just really good. Oh, another guy's are really good. I'm more of a missionaries. Man, those guys take a lot of rejection. I hang out with several of them and go, how'd you guys do that? You know, how did you do that? You know, and you're not going to do it. I'm from the Mormon church. Yeah. I said, Jesus, the best training you could get. How do you not take that personally? And how do you be a good salesperson? That's the trick. That's the trick. If you're like, they call it a snag, a sensitive new age guy. It's hard to get ahead. It's hard to get ahead. But there's so many people, they take things so personally. And I told, I, I should have mentioned the names, but I won't mentioned. I told this one person, you charge too much money. They got so upset with me. So my friends are complaining about you. They can't take feedback. Feedback is how we learn. How often do you get feedback where people come to you and say, here's my thoughts about what you're doing and how do you know whether or not to listen to somebody? That's a tough, it's a good question because a lot of times I'm a, I have such a nice temper. It's not good. It's not healthy. So I've got to learn to control my temper and actually seek the feedback. It's a discipline I have. I think it's changed as you age and do better and all this stuff. So life's always about change, change and growth, personal development. I like what you guys are doing, like I said, and I love YouTube because a lot of characters on there, you know, a lot of, a lot of, but I listen to them too. You know, just keep your mind open and talk along. But how do you decide what to listen to and take to heart and maybe make changes versus someone just giving you advice that's maybe incorrect? It's a risk you take. I think the most important lesson I learned was I studied with a man named Dr. R. Buckminster Fuller. He's got an infant at the geodesic dome. So if you go, I went to the Montreal, Montreal World Expo in 67. The U.S. Pavilion was Bucky Fuller's dome and I'm in there with my classmate. But I had studied Fuller. He considered one of the greatest geniuses of our time. I'm still in full of this one, look at this thing. So I went to study with him. The lesson I learned, choose your teachers wisely. So once I understood that I wanted to study with Fuller, I tracked him down. So when he gave a seminar, I went to listen to him. So I studied with Fuller for three summers, once a year, once in Hawaii, once there. And I sat there with him and he asked me, because it was a class of about 100 people, and I'm sitting there, I don't like to share things by myself. And he kind of said, hey, what's your life's purpose? And here he is, the world's greatest genius, Buckminster Fuller. John Denver wrote songs about him, all this stuff. I said, I'm going to get rich. And in front of 100 people, he chews me out. Young man, young man, young man, getting rich is a waste of a good mind. I went, what? So here's all his groupies who love him. I'm getting my ass chewed up by Bucky Fuller, you know? And he goes, well, what am I supposed to do? He says, ask yourself this, young man, what does God want done? I said, what? What does God want done? Not what do you want to do? What does God want done? So I'm hurting inside because he chewed me out in front of 100 people. And nobody else could chew it out. But the lesson hit me, it says, what does God want done? So this was studying this in Reno, Nevada, in the mountains. So I left there and I said, what does God want done? I thought about it and thought about it, thought about it. And I created my cash flow board game, and I wrote Rich Dad Board. I said, there's no financial education at schools. I think if I was God, that's what I would want. And that was in 96 and 97. And now those board games have gone all over the world. Did you know when you wrote the book that it was going to be a hit? I had to have flunked that high school twice because I can't write. That's not that I can't write. The teacher didn't like what I was writing. But the question I leave for young men like you, what does God want done? You know, you can see it. And for me, I was kind of naturally interested in money. So I naturally studied money. And so when Dave Ramsey says, live debt free, I said, well, if you understood money, Dave, you know, you stop borrowing money and the economy stops. What are you going to do? You know, you couldn't answer the question. When's the last time you changed your mind on something? All the time, all the time. In any significant way, anytime in the past few years or recently? Recently, yeah. Like going to Zimbabwe. You know, I said it there. How did that change your mind, though? I realized I made a promise back in 2002. There's a poem by, I wrote about it in Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Frost. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I promised us to keep and miles to go before I sleep and miles to go before I sleep. The title of the poem was The Roadless Traveled. I said, what am I supposed to do? I said, I'm supposed to come back to Zimbabwe and teach. I said, I can't pay it. Zero. But I made a promise to those people in 2002. I had to come back because I had promises to keep. So now my cashflow board game's there. They're teaching everybody. I'm doing 120 games and they're going to start clubs all around Zimbabwe to teach people money. Come up. Because I've kept the promise. I'm going to teach these people. Or allow them the possibility of learning because they're not going to learn in school. Yeah. One of the richest countries in the world used to be called Rhodesia. Now it's Zimbabwe. The biggest financial disaster in history took place there. The Zim Dollar. The U.S. dollar's next. So I'm practicing. How do you now define wealth or success now that you have basically all of the money anyone could ever ask for? What does God want done? So you ask yourself that, come to an answer, and then pursue that. What emphasis do you place on legacy? Not much. When I'm dead, that's it. You don't have any children. What are you going to do with your money? That's going to my ex-wife. She's going to manage it. It's going to be a big foundation and all that. But I haven't decided how. That's a project I'm working on now. That's a very important question. What's one daily habit you never will skip? I get up every morning and take, I want to call it spiritual. But the kind of spiritual readings. And I don't just read it, I write it. And I write it three times. So it might be a paragraph. So it might be a paragraph. Because I studied from Maria Montessori in the Montessori school system. Great entrepreneur. She says what the hand does, the mind remembers. So if I just read spiritual words, when I have to write them, it embeds. So that's one habit I get up and I basically, not plagiarize them, just, oh, it's a nice passage. I write it three times. And I set the day off with that. Who would you say is the biggest mentor or influence on your life? Buckminster Fuller. The happiest thing about my life is, not really religious, but I believe there's a God. And this vibration is that we go through in life. Like I feel good here. Go someplace else, you don't feel so good. So I'm going to do a whole series with another guy on Bucky Fuller now. So like you guys do an ice coffee hour. I'm going to do one on Bucky Fuller, the greatest Jesus of our time. And that makes my heart happy. So that's, that's God telling me you're on course because the frequent, you know, the, it feels good. If you were to finish this sentence, money is blank. What would you put in the book? Freedom. Freedom. Cool. Robert, thank you. Thank you so much for coming on the ice coffee hour. This was honestly a blast. This was an honor, a pleasure. Your insights are phenomenal. I love not only like the money and finance conversation, but also just the life and everything. And I think it's also interesting. What would God want? Asking yourself that and then just gearing your actions towards it. Yeah. What does God want done? And then go do it. Thank you. This is an honor. Thank you. Appreciate it. Till next time. Thank you.
