Hello everybody, welcome back to the podcast for today's guest. We have Sal Vilcano and a Black Israelite. It's going to be a special episode. You guys can come on in now. For today's co-host, we have my manager Vyra Floring, Gideon Vyra Floring. Now, I don't do repeat guests, which is why Sal is here and I wanted to kind of mix it and make it special so it's not a little boring and all that one. So that's why Sal, you know, because of some of the things he said online, I wanted to sort of confront him with this a little bit and make it a special episode. Hey, slightly biased, you didn't say my name. Black Israelite. Tzariach, I believe. That's not a name. Nobody walks around and say, they say, hey, what's your name? Black Jewish? No, hell no. Something like that? No, Tzariach would be better. I don't know how to pronounce that. You got to be kidding me now. But regardless, just please, each of you, keep that mic there for later purposes. For later purposes? Yeah, just please introduce yourself in case anybody doesn't know you from the last episode. Maybe they didn't see it. I think after you can tell them about the black people. My name is Sal Volcano. And I didn't know you didn't have a repeat guest, so I'm honored to be back on. Yeah. I kind of wanted to cut, after the last. Please ignore my manager. He has a box of funny stuff. He got a brand new toy. Go ahead, sorry about that. No, I also was going to come back on because after last time I just felt like, you know, it was a weird interview and I want to come back on and just kind of maybe make it right. A more normal one. Yeah, a more normal interview. This will be more serious, I'll tell you that. All right. And go ahead, tell us, I guess, I'm sure most familiar with the black people. Yeah, yeah, I see the bias already from my European counterparts. My name is Captain Tzariak of ISPK under Commander Jenin Haana. Are you speaking English? Yeah, what is that? You just started speaking in like stuff I didn't understand. I said I am captain. You know what a captain is, right? That's an English word. You drive ships? No, no. If a police chief said or somebody, a police officer said, they drive ships, they drive ships. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. If a police chief said or somebody, a police officer said they was a captain, would you think ships? No, you would. They're in the Navy. The police? Yeah, the police. Who do you think is policing the ocean? That's a good one. You're pretty good on your feet. Look, a black person, I just touched a white man's face. You see that? We're not that bad, clearly. That was a big accomplishment like 300 years ago. Listen, man, you just grew up. Hey, is this unleavened bread? Or is this leavened bread? I don't know what that means. I'm sure these are different types of bread. Yeah, what made you put the bread up? What made you use the bread? I won't be eating any of the bread. You're not going to be eating the bread? I won't be eating the bread. Would you like any rape juice? No, I'm good. It depends if it's the rape juice. That's what this is, rape juice? Rope juice. Y'all couldn't afford like Manny Shevitz or nothing? Put some real wine up in there? You're trying to confuse me by using these words? I figured you know that. Aren't you Jewish? I'm formerly Jewish. Now I'm a white man. How do you do that? Fighting for white power. Wait, that's kind of a reverse because you changed your voice to speak what I thought was Arabic. I thought you was an Arab at first. But you changed your voice to be more Jewish. So how could you? No, to be more stern and serious. You think that voice makes you more stern and serious? Yes, I sound kind of more like you to be honest, which I don't know how to. Mine is natural though. So what? It's like going to the gym. What is this again? This is rape juice. Okay. Anyways, let's get into the question. I'm not going to drink it unless it's asking for it. That kind of eliminates the whole purpose of that. Okay. You bought them yourself? He has the funny box, okay? I see. Sal, you've said the movement began with Frank Cherry who claimed he had a dream revealing that black Americans are the true Israelites. There's no evidence to support that. It's a belief born from some man's vision with no historical backing. Wow. Go ahead. Can you just repeat my quote one more time? The movement began with Frank Cherry who claimed he had a dream revealing that black Americans are the true Israelites. There's no evidence to support that. It's a belief from some man's vision with no historical backing. I said that? That's what you said. And can you explain why you would say that? Is that what you truly believe? Okay. Did I? By the way, please keep off your phone if possible. Yes. Look, he's bossing me around. I'm just trying to remember a place where I said that. I think it was at the... I'm not asking where you said it. I'm asking you to go more in depth and then we'll let him respond. I might have said that at the Met Gala. The Met Gala? Yeah. You know, like anything... He looks like he's dressed up for it. Like anything I... I think that required a restraint. I seek answers. I'm curious about things. Donald, you weren't seeking answers. You were making a stern point against black Israelites. Smells pretty good. Yeah, it wasn't. Yeah, that sounded like a statement. Well, it's tomato-tomato on that. No, that's not tomato-tomato. Well, it's tomato-tomato. Well, I guess you want to respond. No, because if you say... He's a little scared of you in person. If you say that it was fabricated as fake, you must have proof that it was fake. Well, I... Just like any religion, even like Catholicism or whatever, it started a long time ago and it's passed down. Is Catholicism fake? What's that? Is Catholicism fake? As far as the founders, how they say they founded Catholicism, is that fake? Yeah, I don't read it literally. Read what? I don't take a literal sense of the Bible. So I do think that... I'm talking about the Bible. I'm talking about when Catholicism is after the Bible. Stop fucking with me, you Edomite. Yeah. He learned. Listen, listen. Good job. Good job. Kiss my boot. You talk about your brother, though, just so you know. Did you Google hot Israelite phrases? Yes, clearly. He got all the phrases down. Kiss my boot, Edomite. Hey, if you get him to kiss your boot, that'll be done. That'll be fired. You kiss my boots? Hell no. Why is that? Because our people did that already. You can kiss my boot, though. Yeah, you guys are already familiar. It's in your blood. No, it's not. Well, I tell you what, we got to get it familiar in your blood. Nobody had mentioned that. What's better than your young blood getting all your things doing? That's a little weird. Something, why young? Because you're young in age. So it's better to get the youth ready. Because I'm a minor? What, you're 18 now, right? No, I'm 17. Okay, no problem. 17-year-old, you can get right down there. I won't go to jail if you got on your knees and kiss the boot. Why do you want a 17-year-old to get on his knees? You want to do it? Because it's better to get the youth involved. Go ahead, Sal. Finish what you're saying. Because if an old people get too old and die, they ain't going to be as fruitful. They ain't going to be as spry. Wow. Yeah, you get them young. Finish what you're saying, Sal. Well, I've been taking collagen because my joints have been a little acting up a little bit, and I just got a full blood panel done. No, finish what you're saying about Frank Cherry. Yeah, yeah, Frank Cherry was a liar, man. Because they actually would teach, if you actually did the research, he actually went to jail for teaching that we were Israelites. And that makes it real. That's what I'm saying. If you go to jail for something, it's real. No, no, no. It makes F.S. Cherry doing what he did real. Going to jail does not make it real. It makes him a criminal. If going to jail make it real, it wouldn't be conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk getting killed. Sal is saying that that makes him a criminal. Frank Cherry went to jail because he's a criminal. I don't know if I said that, though. Well, that's what you're implying. No, he didn't say that. No, he didn't say that. Just tell me. One thing I do is I'll put the charge on you if you did it. Thank you, Desiriak. Thank you. No problem. But he didn't say that. I said that he went to jail for teaching. Maybe you should lick everybody's boots. You're going to kiss his boots? I think you should be licking everybody's boots. You can't misquote me. That's right. Kiss my booty, the mic. This one's for you. It's weird saying that Edomite asking another Edomite to kiss his boot. He's licking another Edomite. He's an Edomite. He's got another Edomite. You don't know how to say it. You don't even know how to say it. You can't be an Edomite and ask another Edomite to lick your boot. That's crazy. He's crazy. You guys are getting along now. He's trying to bullshit you. I'm trying to do it. We're forming our own bonds. Here, I have a question. This one's for you. What's up? How can people begin to take you seriously when you say your name is Captain Tazariakia The same way we take anybody's language serious. If I ask somebody the name and they told me my name is Bajabachopo Bajabajambang, I go come on man, be serious with me. You know him? That's not my name. He knows him too. You don't have to know my name. You know you have to care about my name. It's just the actions that you see us do. People take people serious not based off their name but the actions behind the person. The action behind telling people your name is Captain Tazariakia. I'm serious. When you say somebody's name, whether you can pronounce it or not, whatever reputation they establish behind that name is what you think about them. Couldn't agree more with Tazariakia. No, you disagree with him. You're the opposing side. I agree with this. I don't like Obama. I don't like Obama. I'm not going to get into Obama. It don't matter if you know how to say his name or not. When you say his name, if you say my name, my reputation is what you think about whether you know how to say it or not. This is a question for both of you. Do you support interracial marriage for Sal then Black? See how you say that? Sal then Black. That's the theme. But let's remember, Jesus was Black, Moses was Black. When he's saying Black, he's talking about all the Black prophets in the Bible. Sal, was Jesus Black? No, he's got to answer the interracial question first. You interrupted him. Sal, was Jesus Black? No, you called me Black when I got a name. So I don't mind that because Jesus was Black. So we're going to say Black Jesus, Black Moses, Black Isaiah, Black Elijah. We're just going to say Black in front of everybody with names. Right. There you go. You can answer the question now. Okay, which question am I answering? Do you support interracial marriage? Yes. Of course. You do? Yes. Am I not supposed to? Well, anyways, I guess go ahead. You said debate him, but you didn't say I had to take the opposite stance of him. I think you're actually dodging supporting interracial marriage. Oh, he does not. Do you? No, the Bible doesn't support it. Oh, yeah, but I don't really live by the Bible. I live by my own code of ethics. Oh, okay. And I think the heart doesn't choose what it wants. Yeah, that's why I love the Bible. The Bible say the heart deceives for who can know it. But the Bible, God says we can only marry within our race. Is this new or old test? Old Testament enforced by the New Testament because Christ said he didn't come to change the law or the prophets. All right. Am I at the point where you guys are going to start claiming I'm black or is that a little too recent? You? Yeah. Like you. Like you guys took Jesus and Moses. But you ain't black. I just said you're an Edomite. Michael Jackson, you're saying that now. Michael Jackson is definitely black. Edomite. Michael Jackson is not black. But you're an Edomite though. Michael Jackson ain't black? Michael Jackson is not black. Why? Look at him when he died. So you're saying because he had lighter skin, because he bleached his skin, that don't bleach your ethnicity. Sal believes the white race is in danger. Do you agree? You said the white race is what? Sal believes the white race is in danger. Do you agree? Yes, I actually do agree that the white race is in danger because when you talk about abortions, the reason why they reversing the Roe v. Wade is because white women aren't producing their great white glorious babies. Right. They're not having kids. And you're saying we need to have more white babies produced? No, that's what y'all are saying. I don't want y'all to have more babies. I believe the white race is in trouble. Yeah. I believe, just as I believe every race is in trouble though, I think we need to come together a little bit more. No, but specifically, making too much noise. Calm down. But specifically. Hey, I'm causing him to do that. It's not his fault. He's on your side by the way. Yes. He represents you. Who is that to you? That's my manager, but today he's a black Israelite supporter. What's your ethnicity? You don't talk. You don't even want to talk. I forgot. Go ahead. Finish what you were saying, Sal, about the white shit. I'm a little nervous right now. I've never done a podcast like this. All right. He loves it though. Go ahead about the white race. He loves it though. The white race. What would you like to know about them? Why are they in danger and how can we stop them? You know I'm half Hispanic. Yeah. On your father's side? I don't care either way. I'm the moderator. Oh, your mom's. Okay. So your father's side is white? Well, they're from Europe. They're from Europe. They're from Europe. They're from Europe. Okay. Yeah. I don't support the death of any human being. But you don't really care as much as if it was black people. He's just standing there. Yeah, it's not a matter of... He's sitting down. I don't support the death of any human being. But if it was black people, you'd be more concerned. With white people, I feel bad. I think it's natural for you to care about your ethnicity first and then other ethnicities. Okay. So how do you deal with that? I mean, I see... Wow. I think he's being... Stop. You know, I get what he's saying. I get what he's saying. Do you agree with me? But I come from a different place. I just care about humans. Any human. It doesn't matter if you're a different race. I don't... You're trying to be on the border. You're a fence cheater right now. No, I wouldn't care about... Okay, bring the race. It has nothing to do with race. Bring the race. Bring the race. Bring the race. Bring the race. Bring the race. Bring the race. Bring the race. Bring the race. Bring the race. Bring the race. Bring the race. It has nothing to do with race. Bring in the rabbis, please. It has nothing to do with race. Who is it now? Bring in the rabbis. Okay. Now, I had a feeling, unfortunately, that Sal was going to be a little bit scared of the black man here. I mean, he's a little bit scary. I'm proceeding closer to him, but... Black Moses. So just in case I got two rabbis here to take him on. Why two? I had one and then he canceled and then I tried to get another one, but then I got two together and I felt bad to cancel on one of them. You got a case of too many rabbis. I don't get it. We have two rabbis. Do you want to come sit? A lot of small hats, right? Yeah? Yeah, I like the shortened words. I'm usually in a rush. A lot of small hats. It's a pleasure to meet you. Where's the other rabbi, by the way? They want both of us. Bring in the other rabbi. Oh, that's the big hat. How are you? You got the big hat? I know it's tight. I'll try to get him. Small hat and the big hat. My students call me rabbis. Oh, yeah? Fucking Hazar, fucking Kazar. Kuzarim! Kuzarim! Kuzarim! Kuzarim! You looked up a lot of words before this. I didn't even get a chance to do that. Well, I'm the moderator, all right? I heard about this. It's his job to do research. Hi, how are you, sir? I'm Sal. Menachem. Menachem. Menachem. You got it. You got to put the chom. So Menachem and Brian? Yes. Yes. Huh? One of us assimilated a little bit more. Okay. Are y'all natural Jewish? Here we go. Define natural. We're not lab-made. No, no. I don't know, meaning like your dad, well, y'all go by your mother, but are y'all Jewish like or y'all like American, white? We are American Jews. Okay, so you're Jewish, like from Israel. That's what I mean, from like Israeli. Fuck him. I'm a Jewish American. My parents are both Jewish. Jewish. Are both Jewish. Okay, that's what I was asking. Yeah. From Israel? My father's from Israel. I only say that because when I asked the moderator, he said he wasn't. He wasn't. Jewish. You're talking about me? No, he's not Jewish. You're the moderator. I'm not Jewish. Right. I'm formerly Jewish. Now I'm a white power civil. So that's why, see how he said formerly? I didn't even know you could do that, but apparently. You can't. Prince did something like that. Well, I make these counter points. Prince just took his name in there, right? Because I'm. Yeah, but he changed. He was formerly something, so I'm just trying to draw a parallel. He was formerly Prince. Yeah. Yeah. He just, you just. The Jewish religion says that you can't convert out of Judaism. What, as somebody who doesn't follow or practice it, I can do whatever I want. Right. I think for the most part, any individual could do what they want. Certainly you can choose how you live your life. Right. Spiritual identity. I heard you earlier talk about the father in the book of Numbers, chapter one. It says. I'm talking about that? I think you talk about me, right? Yeah. It says, let me show some of the base of us. We know what tribe you're from based off the father. Right. Up until Mount Sinai, everything was according to the father. And then we change the book of Ezra and the Chamiah. Change the spiritual identity goes according to the mother. Everything else goes according to the father. But, but usually today everything goes according to the spiritual identity. That's a lie. Mission. Well, I mean, a lie. I mean, we could disagree. No, that's a lie. Like you're always according to your father. Oh, your father makes up the tribe. The tribe. Correct. What tribe you're from, whether you're a Koen, whether you're a priest, a Levi, an Israelite, that's all by the father. No, there's 12 tribes of Israel. So you have Judah, Manasseh, Netali, Gad, Benjamin. That's all determined by the father. So your race and ethnicity is by your father. That's why you can't enter marriage. I was making a joke about the rape Jews. Well, in Deuteronomy chapter seven, it says that you may not intermarry. That's true. You're saying you can't take their sons or you can't take their daughters. In terms of interracial marriage, what you had said before, Judaism is not. You're supporting a racial marriage. Yeah, of course. You would marry a non-Jew. That's not in the Torah. That's interfaith. Not interracial. OK, but that's not in the Torah. You know what I mean when I say that. If you're in the Torah, you can intermarry. No, you cannot. Deuteronomy chapter seven is a biblical commandment against intermarriage. But you just said that you can't. No, he said inter-race. What? Judaism is not a race. It's a religion. OK, so now when you say that, whatever you say with Judaism, that's fine. But if we're going by the Torah, you can't intermarry, interracial. You can't do none of that, but based on the Torah. So I'll ask you a simple question. What verse, where in the Jewish scriptures does it say that you cannot interracially marry? Not interfaith. Well, real quick, I have a question. Do you believe that Judaism is sort of an ethnicity as well? No, it can't be. Oh, you don't believe that? It's like Christianity. What about you, Rabbi, with the hat? I assume that's because we're both wearing hats. You have the hat on. He has that little evil thing on. Go ahead. They both evil. By the way, you guys only, they're both evil? I'm evil? No, the hats. The hats. What about the big one? Or just this one? Yeah, both of them. Why are they evil? I like your hat. Because they're not biblical. That's not in the Torah either. They come from Russia. They come off the Russian steppe. Just because it's not in the Torah, just because I'm wearing it makes it evil? Yeah. Is what you're wearing around your head evil? If you wear it like this, a headpiece. That's what Jesus wore, I think. A headpiece or a mitri is in the Bible. Ezekiel wore a mitri. He said, put that tire upon thy head and go teach the word. He never said put a yarmulke or the chieftain hat. That's from Russia. So when you represent that as Judaism, you're fine. But when you represent it as a Torah, it's wrong. We fundamentally disagree 100%. Well, you can't show me that hat in the Torah. No, there is no biblical comment. You're right. I believe in something called, so we should have definitions. Oh, you got him there. I give a point to the black. We should have definitions made clear. For example, when he say to the black, he's saying black Jesus, black Moses, black Elijah. Well, to be clear, I don't think any of those people are black. They're all black. I don't think a single one of them is black. We're all of them black. And neither does Saul, by the way, or these two Jews. All of them black. I don't think so. Are they black? Do you think Jesus is black? Which one? You know, you know. Jesus? He doesn't think Jesus is black. Well, they're from the Middle East. Middle East are brown olive skin. Has anybody seen the new Dancing with the Stars? But even the olive is black, you know. So when you say olive skin, it's still saying black. He got you. Your analogy doesn't work. What color people are has no, I mean, that doesn't matter. That is diabolical to say when y'all created colorism. Who's y'all? What are you talking about? When I'm saying y'all. Speaking of diabolical, there's a new season of Hell's Kitchen that just started that is a real promo. Saul, don't try to cop out here. Saul, we're going to get you in on the debate in a minute. When I say y'all, whether it's Jewish or Europeans, which are all Edomites, y'all created race. Y'all took Christ made him white when he wasn't. If you describe, like, for example, when Moses put his hand in his bosom, took it out, it was white. When he put it back in, it was black. Excuse me. Like the rest of his skin brown. You said put his hand in his ass? Bosom. Yo, what does that mean? I forgot you a young kid. But you too intelligent, so I know what you're doing. He took his hand in his... Bosom is this area. He took Christ in his... Bosom is this area. Look. What are you pointing to? I can't see the moderator sleeping. Why is he surprising that he had shit all over his hand? Shit is not usually white unless you drank a Slurpee. Well, if you did it, you'd probably be putting it in his ass though, because y'all freaky like that. I'm not gay or anything. Don't project on me. I ain't say gay. I said freaky, because you won't call yourself gay when you do freaky shit. I'm not gay at all. No, no. Yeah, see? Your manager agrees with me. I have a clarifying question. You... I'm sorry. Hold on one second. I just... I want to keep the interview flowing. I want to make sure that we're on appropriate timing. Who here is the best at basketball? What do you guys think? He's raising his hand. You better at basketball? Could be, man. You think you're better at basketball than this guy? He looks like Michael Jordan. I'm taller. I'm taller. I'm taller. I'm taller. I'm taller. I'm taller. I'm taller. I'm taller. I'm taller. I'm taller. I'm taller. I'm taller. I'm taller. You taller than me? I'm a Jewish 6'2". Oh, that's like... I must be a Goliath 8'9", or something like that. Not taller than me, but, you know. Yeah, but didn't that guy lose the fight? Yeah, that was a bad analogy. That's the first one I used a bad analogy. You're a loser is what you're saying. That's cat. That's what you're saying. You just told me I've been winning this whole time. You can't say something like that. And now you compared yourself to a loser. Don't flip-flop. In his defense, he was giving you points. He didn't say you won. That's true. Now he got a point. That's the same thing. Did he give you points? He just won. He only saying that to me, the moderator, because he's biased. Did you get any points? Nope. Well, we won at basketball, which... You didn't win at basketball because we haven't played it. Anybody can talk. You gotta play it. Hold on a minute. Like how we're battling now and that's how you get the winner? Hold on a minute. Yeah. I'm not sure if you're going to say that. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.ables? Hey guys, sorry for the interruption.

But there's only one Jew here. Who is that? Me. Sal interprets the question differently. He actually... That was cold. Go ahead. I'm not saying anything. No him. Sal. I would, is this like a riddle? I would kill myself. You're not Jewish though. Jesus Christ. I'm not gonna, I can't, how can I do that? I can't pick only one to survive? That's the question. Otherwise they all die. I'd lend you my hat. What's that? I'd lend you my hat. I appreciate that. Sorry, you're making deals Jewish? Go ahead, Sal. I really don't know how to answer the question. I don't want to let anyone down here but I don't come from this position where I would eliminate anybody. I guess would everyone have to die? You have to get rid of two of these Jews here. Are you Jewish? Mr. Floring? Is he Jewish as well? No he's not. Are you asking the black guy who keeps trying to tell you that he's Jewish even though he's black? I'm not Jewish. I'm a Jew. You're black. I'm a Jew. You're an African American. How can you be two continents? Just break that down. That is possibly the dumbest question I've ever heard. How can I be African and American? Because you're from Africa but you're American. That's our whole continent. I'm not from Africa. Right, that's how that works. Africa is a big continent with like 40 countries and then little villages in each of those countries. You know what that means? When somebody says they're European. Genetically you're from Africa but you're considered American? No I'm not genetically from Africa either. I'm not African. I don't even like Africans. Which one of these guys would you keep alive? For the sake of the... Who would I keep alive? Yeah, you gotta pick one of these. That's the point. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10. Let's pick it. Okay, you would stay alive. Thank you. It's just a coincidence. Once I'm alive can I pick another one to add to the living list? Shay! Sal, why did you decide to eliminate the other two Jews here? It was getting exhaustive. Rabbi, how will the weather be tomorrow? We haven't decided. Now look, the other Rabbi answered. I don't think he gets it. Hot. It'll be hot again. Why? That's what my Apple Weather channel told me. Sal, did you know the first man on the moon was black? So was the man who made the telephone. So was the man who made the wheel. So was the man who made the radio. And so was the man who made the Xbox. Watch your rebuttal, Sal. My rebuttal? Yup. My rebuttal game crazy. What am I rebutting? I guess that all of those people were black according to him. Oh, so that's not true? It is according to him. I never said no shit like that. I don't know how to rebut that. If that's a fact, is that a fact? I never said no shit like that. Well, Google says the guy was white. Some of them were white. All of them were white. I don't think nobody on the moon was black. I would just fact check it, you know? Why didn't the black man go to the moon? You said what? You're saying that nobody was black on the moon? Yeah, I don't think when they went to the moon, any of those astronauts was black. Oh, you guys haven't claimed them yet? We don't claim. Unlike white people, we don't steal something we didn't create. Uh-uh. What do we steal that we can't? You guys took Jesus and Moses for one? No, y'all stole them. That's a fundamental disagreement. I'll pass the conversation onto the rabbi with the heart. I'm the moderator, right? I'm the moderator, rabbi with the heart. Go ahead. Was Jesus and Moses black? My question is why are we so stuck in this? Why does it really matter? That's part of his whole religion, I guess. No, it's not, actually. We just follow the truth of the Bible. The only reason we have to establish the identity of anybody in the Bible is because Edomites or Europeans came and changed what they were. Why would you assume we're from Europe? Where else are you from? I remember Helen Thomas was a news reporter. Washington, D.C. for like 50 years. And she said, y'all should go back home. And they asked her, they said, where's home at? She said, Poland, Russia, and Germany. They fired her that night. So a couple of things. Y'all are not originally from the Middle East. I actually have family from Spain. We are originally from the Middle East. Spain is not the Middle East. But also my question to you is what? You said Spain like that was Middle East. You lost the point for that. I have relatives from Spain as well. But how did the Jews get to Europe? We just sprouted. The bigger question is how did y'all get to Israel? Historically, y'all wasn't looking for Israel first. Y'all went to Haiti. Y'all went to South America. Y'all was looking in Africa. Y'all was looking anywhere to go. If you look at it. If you go back to the Belford Act and all of that that y'all did, that's why you had that one Palestine because you broke every treaty that you even had with the Palestinians. That's a whole separate conversation. That's a whole separate conversation. No, you're asking how did you get there. So y'all was in Germany having war with another set of white people because y'all all white. They went to America to fight for y'all. And then they were like where are we going to place these people? And so again, if you look historically, they were going to place you in South America. They were going to place you in Haiti. They were going to place you in Africa. And then the Palestinians welcomed y'all with open arms. Thinking that y'all was only going to bring a certain amount of people. Thinking that y'all wasn't going to expand in certain other areas. And then what did y'all do like white people do? Broke the treaties and just decided we're going to take more and more and more and more land from them. So that land was never yours. It's not the Palestinians either, but at least they were there before y'all got there. What you're saying is factually 1000% false. If you look at any DNA. I can pull up the bell for that. No, for the<|th|>. If you did a DNA test, you're going to be off the top of the world. If you did a DNA test of me, the language, the life, the coins, the Torah, everything shows that the Jews were there for thousands of years. To suggest that we weren't, I would suggest why don't you go do a DNA test. I'll do a DNA test and we'll link that back and see. But the white man owns a DNA company. To compare Israelis. So now, so now, now, I'm currently on tour. This is a statement about you, but when you say DNA test, so the very people that took away the DNA, the very people that took away the DNA, so the very people that took away the identity of black people, you want me to go to them to give me my identity. They're going to lie to you. I have a new talk show coming out called Manouche. On the subject of DNA for your ancestry, it's not even accurate. You can only go so far, you can only go back so many generations. Why? Because like if you DNA for a child, that's live data. For a murder, that's live data. If you go to the police, you can get live data. But at some point, it's just a guess. I'll give you a checkmate. If you look at the Kohanim, if you look at the priests, and their Y chromosomes, they have a very unique set of Y chromosomes bundled together. It is unique to them only. And it goes back over 3,000 years to one common person. And who said that? Who said that? Who gave this information? The same Jewish people that lied. The white man! That lied. It's the same Jewish people that you think are going to be honest. That's why when I'm talking about DNA for ancestry, I'm not even being biased about Jewish or not. I'm saying DNA for ancestry itself is just not reliable to go back 3,000 years. We can't have a conversation if every time we say something, you just say that we can't prove it even though we can and yet you haven't proved anything. You're just making big bolts. How do we know you're not from New York? To be fair, hold on. He has an unbeatable DNA. He has an unbeatable argument because every time you present him with facts and evidence he claims it's from the white man. So how can you beat somebody who doesn't accept any sort of proof? That's actually not what I said. You got him. Pound it on that one. You won't pound that one because I got him. No, no. Because I know what you were doing. I mentioned the bell for that. That's facts. The treaties that you all signed with them and then broke them, that's also facts. The Palestinians welcoming y'all, that's also facts. What I said about DNA, I didn't deny that. Who were the first so when? For example, when I was in Israel, there's a section in Israel where Israelites of my hue never left Israel from the exile when the Romans invaded Israel in 70 AD. So I can make that claim because I went over there, I interviewed them, I have it if I need to, I can't grab my phone, but I have the information. So I can make that claim because I went over there, but I have the information. So what we're talking about is you guys converted around 600 AD to Judaism. And it's no different than when white people believed the dead Americans when you have the native indigenous people that was here first. Oh my god. I don't even know what he just said I was eating the bread. Go ahead. You're fucking that bread up. That you just said is so factually just wrong. It's not. You are fucking that bread up though. First of all, you called us Edomites. Edomites. E-do-mites. Kuzarim! That comes across as the children of Asav. Who? Esau. Esau, yeah. So that's who I am. All white people come from Esau. What? Esau you said? I'm trying to learn. This is nuts. I know because you're hearing the truth for the first time in your life. All I would say to you is it's very simple. You and I it seems like you believe in the veracity of the Jewish scriptures. Yes, of the Israelite scriptures, yes I do. Okay. So all I would ask you is very simple questions. Where in the 29,000 verses of the Jewish scriptures from the beginning of Genesis to the end of Malachi does it say anything that you just claimed? As far as y'all being Edomites? As far as again, what color people were, it doesn't matter. Jews, it's not a race. If color didn't matter when Esau was born, was his color described in the Bible? Yes, it's very rare. Then you can't say color don't. You know why you say it's very rare? Because it doesn't describe the color of any other child being born. Including Israelites being black. But what color was he? You know why I don't have to describe? What color does it say he was in the Torah? It says he was red. Are we red? He was red. Are we red? He was red and hairy all over. He's red and hairy. He's dressed like a red. When it's talking about red, it ain't talking about being flesh and blood red. It's talking about the color that y'all get. And you know why I describe Esau and not no other race? Because every other race had melanin. Y'all were the first people born that did not have the melanin makeup that everybody else. I'm trying to study the Torah. Red is lack of melanin? Yes. That's what color comes out of. Lack of melanin. If you have a lot of melanin, you'll be dark. If you don't have a lot of melanin, you'll be light. No melanin is yellow, is red? No. If you can be albino. You can be albino, which would be whiter. But the bigger point is when Esau was born, the reason why the description of him was described was because before he was born, that color did not exist. Exactly. Okay. And your color, the Caucasoid mountain, man, that comes from the Caucasian mountains, was born red and hairy all over. And what else did it say? It said he would live by the sword. And that's how white people live. Y'all are bombing the hell out of the Palestinians because y'all live by the sword. America lives by the sword. That's how y'all live. The sword. What am I supposed to say? Sword? No, I like saying sword better. Are you suggesting that had the Palestinian had Hamas, I should say, had Hamas not done what they did on October 7th, the Jews would have gone in there and did what they did? I'm saying something a little different than that. What I'm saying is that if y'all would have held to the treaty that y'all agreed with the Palestinians, what I'm saying is y'all might not even have had October 7th ever. There are zero Jews in Gaza. There are two million Arabs who live. There are 20 million dead babies at the hand of y'all not getting along with the Palestinians. How many babies do you have to kill? It is the opposite of what you're claiming the Jews do. Everybody is welcome in Israel. Quick question. Hold on. When black people from Chicago went to Israel, when they went to Israel, y'all did not accept them. The only way y'all accepted them was if they allowed their kids to be a part of your military. Even when they did that, y'all tried to export them. Deport. Y'all tried to deport them. So when you say y'all accepting everybody, that's just not true. Y'all don't accept the Ethiopian Jews. Y'all don't accept them all. Are you kidding me? Of course we accept the Ethiopian Jews. I said all. I'm very clear on what I'm saying. So when you say y'all accept them all. Are Ethiopian Jews like you or are they like us? Well, if they're Israelites, they're like us. If they're actual Ethiopians, then they would be like you. We're talking about... I thought we're all red. I don't even think he might be too slow to get one. Quick question around the table. Just so we can establish... Hold on. Hold on. I just want to establish some point. Are you guys pro-Israel? Yeah. I'm an underbath Zionist. How y'all feel about that? Your own fellow Eidemite is not pro-Israel. It's not his fault. It's allergy season. How do y'all feel about that? Feel about what? Him not being pro-Israel and he's an Israelite. I'm not an Eidemite. I'm a kuzarin. People have different tastes. People have different outlooks. And I know that I'm not going to agree with everybody. And not everybody's going to agree with me. And that's okay. Right. Agree. First of all, I don't want anybody to die. This isn't about death. Didn't you say you hated the Arabs? No. That's what I heard. And this is just alleged. I heard that he was high on drugs. I'm just saying. Which drug? I heard you were high on drugs. I'm impressed with your research. I didn't research. That's what I was told. Sal, did you tell me? No. I just arrived shortly after you. I'm not pro-Palestine. Oh, okay. What? So who are you pro? You just want them to kill each other so you can criticize them. And go look at all the funny white people killing each other. All the black people don't do that all the time to each other in Chicago, for example. Huh? No. Did you know black on black crime is a majority of the violence, Israelite? Boom. I got a point as the moderator. I'm actually glad you said that. There's 49 to 50 million black people. And they won't stop shooting each other. They're going to kill each other. They're going to kill each other. When they say 15%, like we're 15%. Yeah. That 55% that we so-called murder each other, even that's a lie. Because that's just not from the white man. Let's break it down. Well, first of all, I was actually on a live stream. And when we're talking about numbers, remember, we're getting the numbers from the FBI. Those numbers could be true, those numbers could be false. But what those numbers represent are arrests. They don't represent convictions. When Obama was the president, why were the numbers the same? When did he want to fall? Wait, wait, wait. Here's my point. The most exonerated ethnicity in America is also black people. So what that means is the same black people that are getting arrested for crimes are also getting released from jail for crimes that they didn't commit. Why? Because you had stop and frisk. You have false arrests. There's a ton of those things that happen to black people all the time. So if you're going by the numbers. What does stop and frisk have to do with violent crimes? I'm going to tell you, because when they're arresting people and saying they're committing them violent crimes, they're not always committing those crimes. Someone else is committing the crimes. Now, does that mean that black people don't kill each other? No, it does not. At a higher rate than whites, for sure. No, no. Well, I think, ask Charlie Kirk how you feel about that. Because Charlie Kirk said, I would more than likely get... Yeah, but you're giving one example, right? No, I'm not finished. The day that Charlie Kirk died, a little white 16 year old kid shot up a kid's school in Colorado. Then three days from that, a white guy shot and killed three police officers. And then two days after that... I feel like everybody is under the impression that a majority of school shootings happen from white people. Yet, despite that, when you look at the violent crime rate, the white people are not making up a majority of it. You got old. No, we're not. Rabbi, the red one over there, go ahead. You just got old. You tried bringing up Charlie Kirk and doing funny things. You know what? You know what? You know what? You know what? You tried bringing up Charlie Kirk and doing funny things. That's rude. You know when someone gets owned and when they get interrupted by the moderator. You'll keep... I'm not the moderator, I'm a debater. No, I'm a moderator. He's the moderator. Okay, so since he don't talk at all, I'll finish. He's keeping it calm. So, America would have a better way to communicate if they just called it crime. Not black, not white, just crime. That's not how that works though. You know why it don't work like that? Because... Because America would deprive you, you know what I mean? No. Okay, if you go back into the 70s... But that's not what I'm talking about. When you're dealing with crime, if America treated it as just crime, If America treated it as just crime, there wouldn't be me or you picking sides as the who's worse or who's bad. there wouldn't be me or you picking sides as the who's worse or who's bad. there wouldn't be me or you picking sides as the who's worse or who's bad. It would just be crime. But for political reasons and because America is race driven, That's why they make it a black and white thing. It don't have to be a black and white thing. I don't want to spend... No problem. I want to keep switching the topics. Sal, do you think white people should get reparations for slavery? Should give or get? Get. They're the ones who lost the property there, am I wrong? They're the ones who lost the property there, am I wrong? What's the question? That they get back? They get back what? It doesn't seem like we're going to be able to give white people slaves, so should we give them an amount of money to make up for it? So should we give them an amount of money to make up for it? Because the future generations of white people have had less than their ancestors, because of this law? No. I'm in the camp against slavery. I'm not asking to bring back slavery. I'm asking if the white people should get paid since they lost their slaves? No, I don't believe that should be the case. No. And do you think that black people should get reparations so they can buy an X-Box? Is that what you think? They will buy with reparations? I took a poll, I said, The new Xbox? Or like a used, because you can get a GameStop. It depends how much, right? Now you can get the last version, like gently used at a very, like a better price point. Did you get the gently used version or the new one? Not from reparations, but if I was at the store, I would get the new one. See, he's already, he wants a new one. Yeah, if you're a gamer, you're gonna go for the new one because they made a lot of slides in the technology. But if you're a casual gamer, you might wanna take a nice discount on an older model slightly used, gently used. If you're a gamer, you're gonna go for the new processing power. You want the latest and greatest. But if you get your reparations and you wanna spend it, if you're not a gamer like that, then you maybe wanna go for like maybe the last generation model. We got the holidays coming up. You might be able to get a couple of used games in a bundle. They do bundles. So in general, do you support reparations for whites? No. I would say no. What about for blacks? Did we promise them that? What does that matter? Well, I mean, promises matter. Especially when you lie. I'm willing to lie. I'm not against that. You an Edamite. I expect you to say that. You're an Edamite. You're not. Says who? Says the Edamite. Says my daddy. Says the Edamite. Says my daddy. Let's move on. He's a simple man, your manager, yeah? I'm me over here chilling. I'm liking the toys and the race cars and stuff. He's got a lollipop. Got Patrick over there, SpongeBob. I told you he was gonna bring his fun box. Yeah. He's on your side, by the way, so you shouldn't laugh at him. He negotiates contracts with you, that, him? He's a genius, man. He doesn't bring me a single contract. He's a genius. He signed both of us. He's doing a good job. Should it be allowed to shoot somebody with a harpoon through the chest? We'll start with the Jews. No. Also no. If that's the weapon you got to defend yourself, absolutely. Why the chest, specifically? Hold on. You need to let Sal answer. Can you give me some context or some color on that? Like, what's the scenario? Because it's hilarious. Am I being attacked? No, it's hilarious. A harpoon through the chest is funny, because it's gonna rip through that. Yeah. Yeah. It's okay to have a little violence. It's okay. If I'm being attacked and I have a harpoon. That's what I'm saying. That's what I said. No, not for defense, because it's funny. You know, he's a prankster, by the way. I wouldn't do it. That's why I prefaced it. I said if you're defending yourself, that's the only time you can use any violence. And by the way, I wanted to ask, why are all of the impractical jokers white men, huh? Why aren't some of them black Israelites? Yep. Nah, nah, because what's the funniest joker on the internet is, I can't even remember his name now. I'm talking about his show specifically. Oh, okay, nevermind. I'll be quiet then. Okay, shut up then. Drewski show. You just picked him because he's black, come on. You said they're only white. So I had to name a black person. You said he's the funniest one. He is the funniest. Why, because he's black? No, because this shit is funny. If he can do white face, I can be able to do black face. Yes, you should. Let me. Exactly. Listen, when Tropic Thunder came out. Wait, when Tropic Thunder came out and Robert Downey Jr. played that black guy, that shit was hilarious. It was amazing. This generation is too sensitive. Yup. Rabbis, have you ever done black face? No. I don't know what that is. Come on, it's in the name, black face. Making yourself look like a gangster? No. So you put on black face and you're a gangster, you can still be a wimp. If I put on black face, it's almost as- You would look like a wimp. Well, that might be true, but I disagree. I wanna do it not to be funny like Robert Downey Jr., but as sort of a defense mechanism, so instead, when I'm walking down the street, people are crossing to avoid me. Right, but if you just coloring your skin, you don't look- Then I'm gonna be the scary one. No. Yeah. You scary now, like when you was coming down the street, I say, oh, hey, oh, oh, oh. I get the same impression. Look. Go ahead. Go ahead. Osal, I guess, would you do black face? Would I do it? Yes. Have you done it? No. Would you do it? No. What if this black guy gave you permission? No. Is he too sensitive? No, he has a choice to not do it. Do you think it's funny? No. Would you do some other stories? It was funny when Drusky did it, so you gotta kinda accept it. I think Drusky can do it if I can do it. That's my thing. I'm not offended by what he did. Yeah, back in the days, like we wasn't offended, cause it's comedy. Like it's not, now if you out there trying to, if Drusky was out there trying to seriously do something, then maybe I could see him not doing it. I'm a pretty serious guy. I wouldn't do it for comedy. I don't believe that. But because he's doing any comedy, it's accepted. Like when Robert Downey Jr., it was comedy. When the Wayans kids did White Chicks, it was comedy. But in today's time, everybody's so sensitive about what words you can say, when you can't do this, you can't do that. That's why everybody's so sensitive about it. Back in the days, it wasn't, when I say back in the days, maybe like the 90s up until now, it wasn't that sensitive. You seem to be pretty sensitive about the whole color thing in the Bible. I'm not sensitive about the color thing in the Bible. Cause there's no mention of it. I'm just saying that it's color in the Bible. Nowhere does it say- The N word, for example. Uh oh. Is that in the Bible? Thank you for having me. You're leaving? No. No, no, no. This just a teaching moment. We're just happy to be here. I just don't like, I don't need to wait till the end to be too grateful. I'm just appreciate it. No, just for, and that's why I'm going to say the N word too. So we always- Yeah, I'm just go so glad I'm here for this. The N word itself, is it anywhere in the Bible? Very unbiased. The Torah is written in Hebrew. Yeah. So I believe, so when we was outside, you heard me say, I believe from Genesis to Revelations. So the N word is in the New Testament when it described the disciples in Acts 13 and one, it called them- It's scary too if you think about it. N- pronounced as we would say the N word, and it just means black. Do you want them to say it right now just so we know what you're talking about? No, that's why I'm not saying it. So when we're having a discussion, I think it's important to understand that you and I agree in the Jewish scriptures. Everything to the left of Matthew. But the New Testament is- So you, so for example, if a Mormon came up to a Christian and said, hey, I believe in the veracity of the New Testament, but now there's something else. Every Christian would rightfully say, well, if we believe in the New Testament, then you have to show me Joseph Smith from the New Testament. And then maybe I'll believe you to seek one. So what book do you stop at? What I would say is, you have to show me Jesus in the Jewish scriptures, and then we can talk about the New Testament. What book do you stop at? After Malachi. Do you keep Hanukkah? I keep Hanukkah. So that's after Malachi. That's right. Okay then, so do you keep the Book of Maccabees? Yes or no? So if you're talking about Deuteronomy 4- Do you keep the Book of Maccabees? Yes or no? No, we don't, when you say keep, we keep the oral law, the written law. What I'm asking, if you keep Hanukkah, Hanukkah is in the Book of Maccabees. That's right. Okay then, so do you read that book? I mean, it's a, no, I don't. Then you don't, you can't, okay, this is when we say that white man is the devil, because he said he don't keep nothing after Malachi, but then he said he celebrates Hanukkah, which is in a book after Malachi. I didn't say- What does that have to do with the devil? I didn't say- Why a white man would be the devil? The word devil just means deceiver. So he's saying- But you think the average white man is the devil? I didn't say I don't keep anything after. By the way, the Bible itself refers to Hanukkah. In Leviticus 23, it talks about all the Jewish holidays- Hanukkah is about the eight day celebration when Matathias went to war with the Greeks and won the war, they had an eight day celebration. That's why they light eight candles. They have the eight candles that they light for it. And that's in the book of Maccabees. So that's a book outside of Malachi. So when you say you stop at Malachi, but you celebrate Hanukkah, we got a conundrum there. So my point in saying that is, when Christ and the disciples rode, they were Israelites too. So that is a part of the Israelite history too. And in Acts 13 and one, when that N word is used, it means black. It's from the Latin word that just means black. And that's what they call the Israelites in the New Testament. So they call the Israelites black in the New Testament, then that means that's what they were. No, okay. What's everybody being for Halloween? I don't celebrate Halloween. Y'all celebrate Halloween? No, I'm gonna be Michael Jordan and I'm doing a very realistic version. You gonna dunk the ball? He don't play basketball now. He deal with white women though, so you ain't gotta change that. So you don't like Michael Jordan because he deals with white women? I didn't say I didn't like Michael Jordan. I'm asking you. No, I like Michael Jordan. Okay. Anyways, go ahead. I don't think they're gonna be able to dress up because they have that hat on. This is the costume. Works every year. It definitely is a costume. We have the holiday of Purim that we dress up. I don't. I look fly. I haven't had no problem in the women's department. I couldn't pull that off. Hey man, you gotta have some flavor with it. You gotta have some flavor with it. You look like you're like level 100 in Raid Shadow Legends but you don't look very serious. It's just a mobile game. I'm saying you look like you're from a mobile game. You're like the second final boss. Yeah, I was gonna say in the best possible way, you do look like a final boss. The best possible way. And you know what everybody's trying to do? Fight to get to that final boss. But you don't look like somebody I would meet inside of a building. That was cold, right? That was cold. What did he say? He said, oh, he said that was cold. That was fine sweat. Well, I was gonna- He just called me a final boss. You already? Right, so you gotta fight to get to me. Yeah, but then I'm gonna fight you. Even your man passed it out after he heard that. Even he's with it. That's the moderator. And he's with it. Why you trying to get him involved with it? He involved, listen, he was fine the whole time until I said that. Listen. Hey. Hey, that's what I'm gonna start saying, hey. If I could just respond to what he said. You're gonna be my manager. I already say, hey. You know. When it comes to keeping the Torah, as Orthodox Jews, we don't keep the written law per se. We keep the interpretation of it called the oral law. Tal, do you think African Americans, otherwise known as the real Jews, should be persecuted? And Black, do you think Tal should be persecuted? You want me to go first? You'll go first. Oh, okay. No, I don't think anyone should be persecuted. Whoosh, whoosh. What was that? No. What was that? Go ahead. I don't want Sal to be persecuted. What about those two? Do you think he should be persecuted? I don't want, oh. You think he should be persecuted? No. No, nobody should be persecuted. Right, I don't think they should. We're all equally the children of God. All equally. No, we're not all the children of God, though. I don't think you should be persecuted, though. But we're not all the children of God. Yeah, we seriously disagree on that. What's the trick there? God never said we was all the children of God. We are all equally beautiful. No, we're not. The children of God. People of every race. When I went to school, there was that one little retarded kid in my class. I am not equal to him. It's insulting that you would imply that. But you're homeschooled now. I wasn't for a majority of my life. God created all of us the way he did perfectly. Then why couldn't that guy speak English? Baaah. It's above my pay grade. So then I proved you wrong. Point for the moderator. It seems like he agrees with me. I don't think we're all equal. There's no such thing as equality in the Bible. I'm not referencing the Bible. I'm referencing that kid. In real life, can you show me how? Nobody is equal. Somebody has to be over somebody. That's how you have order. If we're all equal, nobody can tell nobody what to do. So there's no such thing as equality. That's a separate conversation than equally loved by God. We're not all equally loved either. You can love your oldest and youngest child the same. In your Torah, in Amos, does he not say, you only have I known of all the families of the earth? Can I ask you a quick question? Wait, can he answer that first? I can. Yes or no? Did God say that? By the way, you're quoting the same book that says that the Jews will be brought back into Israel, never exiled again, which is what you see right now with the Jews. It says Israel. So where's Reuben, Manasseh, Gad, Nathalie? Where are they at? There are tribes that we don't know where they are. So then that prophecy ain't fulfilled yet then. So now, can you answer my question? Does he say he only knows Israel in that book of Amos? He doesn't say he only. You only have I known of all the families of the earth. That's what it says, yes or no. When you ask for a verse and not context, for example, when people talk about. He's talking about punishing us. That's the context of that verse because he only knows us out of the family. What do you think of Beyonce's country album? I'm just asking for a yes or no. Didn't he say that? Yeah, the new one, yeah. Beyonce is an Israelite, I think. Definitely, Beyonce is an Israelite. What, is she one of ours or one of yours? Ours. Okay. She's not one of yours. I think Stoudemire is one of yours. And just for the record, when I say one of yours, I mean like Judaism, the belief, not the ethnicity. Because Beyonce doesn't call herself an Israelite. I'm saying that because we say black people are Israelites. All, sorry, just clarification. All black people are Israelites? Yeah, but not like African black. I don't know, it's interesting because when you meet African people, they don't like African Americans. And when you meet these African Americans, they don't like the African people. And who's right here? Well, we're more right than them because our reason is twofold. You're more right than them? Yeah, I'm gonna tell you. Okay. Than them, I ain't put an S on that one. You're speaking in what you call ebonics? No, I didn't put no S on that one. Twofold, one they're Hamites, we're not Hamites, we're Shemites. Hamites? They're like a bug? And then, Biblically, excuse me, and then historically, they sold us in slavery. Are they not allowed to make money all of a sudden? They can do whatever they want, but I don't have to love them or affiliate with them. Well, I wouldn't make the argument that- Nobody tells the Jewish man to affiliate with Germans, right? Well, I would argue that if a Jewish man didn't wanna associate with a German, that would maybe not be the best thing. No, but if he says, I don't wanna associate with a German, everybody would say, I get where you're coming from. I don't think that would be the general response, actually. And plus- I think people do understand that. That's why they still lock up. Listen, they will lock up. Let them find a 90-year-old German that had anything to do with World War II, I think it was. But now you're changing the goalpost. You went from German to German in World War II. I'm just showing an example of when Jewish people have an offense or don't wanna get along with Germans, it's understandable. I just said it isn't understandable. I just said it's not understandable. I use the- You know that the German government is like the biggest ally of Israel, we're incredible. By force, yes. I don't disagree with that. I was about to start arguing on your side, then you had to bring it up again. But then- Go ahead, he gets the point. Our separation from the Africans is because of that. That's all I'm simply saying. To judge- I've led two trips to Germany, where I've met children of Nazi- who are the most incredible human beings I've met. And to hold them accountable for what their father did would be inappropriate. Does the Bible hold the sons of the fathers accountable? The ravens off to a one in four star. It says that- That is bad, Lamar Jackson. I got Lamar Jackson and Derry Henry on my phone. Oh, you double-died on him. In two leagues, well, one league, but another league I'm four in one, but that league I'm like three in one. Talk to your guy right here, first round pick Jamar Chase, so I'm bad. But y'all got Joe Flacco though. No, no, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Cleveland, no, no. Cincinnati just traded for Joe Flacco. Oh, did they really? Well, they gotta do something about Browning because he cannot- And they gotta protect him because he older than Burroughs, so they might get sacks and all kind of shit. Yeah. I haven't got Bucky Irving in the second round, and he's been out for a couple of weeks too, so we'll see. I think Nicola Jokic is the best basketball player of all time. The Torah does say that if you do something negative, you'll be held accountable the only time the Torah says it, three or four generations, because most people are raised by parents, they see their grandparents, and if you're lucky enough, you'll see your great-grandparents. And if you saw that your grandfather was a bad person, and you repeated what he did, you're held more accountable because you know how much it hurts people. That's the only time that the Torah makes that reference in terms of being held accountable. Yeah, Isaiah 14 and 21 says, prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers. Shalom. Same idea. Shalom. Shalom. Shalom. If you repeat that, it's hard. No, no, prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers, meaning what their fathers did, the children are gonna pay for. He's doing ebonics again. Totally antithetical to Judaism. What was the ebonic part that time? I don't understand half of the things you say. It's half English, half ebonic. Instead of that accent shit you got going on. Everybody knows what I'm saying, though. We do not. I would highly suggest. Ebonics. I think that you're sincere. And I think that if, truly, if you studied Hebrew and read the Hebrew, Isaiah and the entire Jewish scriptures in Hebrew, you would see a very different translation. I would not. So I read it. You know what I'm saying is, I can read the Hebrew, so I've read it. But you don't understand it. I understand it perfectly. You know how you know I'm better at understanding it than you? You need another book to understand the book you're telling me I gotta read. You need two books. I only need one. I don't need the Talmud. You need two books. He needs one. Does that make you better? So if you only read the first Harry Potter and you don't know how it ends? I'm definitely superior. Doesn't end in the second book. You lost a point. I told a white man that like five weeks ago in a debate. When you tell somebody that you're superior, how are you also saying that that's not racist? What do you mean? Like, to say that you're superior to another race. To think that I'm better than somebody is wrong? Well, it would be racist. I mean, what if, I mean. Let's say if it was a black guy and I said I'm better than you or I'm superior to you. You're saying that you're better than white people. I'm just asking is that racist? Not if he's after the reason because he's black. No, would that be racist if I told a black person I was superior? I mean. No, it wouldn't. So everything, you're making everything about race. When I asked about the feast days you made it about race. When I just said not right now being superior. Sal, calm down. It's not about race. Sal, you need to relax. I just said I'm superior. And why did I say I'm superior? Because I don't need two books. I can read the Torah and the Most High gives me understanding. You said the Most High don't give you understanding. That's why you gotta read two books. I don't need the second book. Correct. Our discussions can be based off the Bible only. That's true. But in terms of knowing how to action the Bible. My message is gonna get to this. I still only need that one book. It's impossible. No, it's not. I'll give you an analogy. When you buy. This is a fun time. This is great. You got me. No, you don't. I don't believe in God? No. How can you tell me what I believe? Because you just said the Most High won't give you the understanding of the Torah. No. I told you before. The way that God created things was he created an imperfect world for us to perfect. If you take out a newspaper, a New York Times newspaper, and you read the headlines, you get the idea. But if you wanna understand what happened, you need to read the body of the story, what actually happened. It's all in the Torah. No, it's not. The written law are the headlines. The Talmud didn't come to thousands of years later, man. You need the oral law to explain it. Put our moderator to sleep. I'm sorry. Too much Torah. He wanted this, man. You're getting what you wanted, man. Complaining at me? Complaining. I have a headache from all of these. I've been drawing this. Because it's like Hebrew ebonics. Boom, bam, bam, bam, in my fucking ear. We've had to listen to y'all wack ass English for hundreds of years. Hey, man. Learn it. You see how you learn to change your voice? You can learn this ebonics. I don't wanna learn your ebonics. I learned to change my voice to be taken more seriously. I don't wanna sound like a gangster. I sound like a gangster? You look like a gangster. Anyways, Jewish now, go ahead. I don't wanna follow up on that. Sal believes that too. Sal, does he look like a gangster? He looks gangster. No, no. Thank you, thank you. Appreciate that, Sal. What do you mean thank you? You just said you look like a gangster. You know what actually pounded on that? He put a little ebonics on it, learn it. I can say gangster too, but if I change, I'm not even gonna go there. Anyways. Thank you. I got a question for you. Just generally, you think that the black people are the chosen people, right? They're the best? We could be the best. That's not what I'm asking. I'm saying just generally? Yeah, if you're the chosen people of God, you were created to be the best. Okay, and I imagine you would want laws passed eventually to help subsidize these things. When you say American laws? Yeah, I think that's what I'm saying. To subsidize these things. When you say American laws? Generally laws, in multiple countries, if that's God will, in your opinion, right? No, no, no, no, no, actually no. It's a little simpler than that. All I would like is just for my people to repent from their sins, obey the most high, and then we can build and reestablish our own communities. And then the only thing I would want from- But at the top of society, you would want black people? Yes. Now let me ask you a question. Why, how, and when- Under God though. Let me ask you, at what point do you think that could happen? Who would ever get behind that besides black people? God will get behind it, which is my point. So, and we- I guess that's an unarguable position on my end, so I guess there's nothing I can really say. Definitely, you have to accept that. I just don't believe that. Historically that's true, because the children of Israel was in captivity in Egypt, and they prayed to God, God sent Moses and destroyed them. It's not historically true that the top of society is African Americans, and I'm not being racist, I'm just being honest. Nobody's seen the Israelites. Sal agrees. Sal, what do you think? Nobody's seen the 12 tribes be in that position, except when we got in Jerusalem. That's why you saw Sheba come to Solomon to get their wisdom, why? Because Israel was at the top. Why did we fall? For our disobedience. So our job is to get them back to being obedient to God, and then we win. Sal, what's your response? I'm just impressed on the strength of people's opinions. I'm not dis-opinionated on it. Well, I guess you didn't believe it's factual. I'm a much more go with the flow guy, so I feel like I'm caught in the crossfire here, but I can appreciate everyone's sentiments. So you're like, Jewish black, Jewish black, who do I agree with, like that? Everyone here seems like really, really great people. I bet you can put that right. Despite opposing viewpoints or controversial viewpoints, they seem like kind people. I don't really wanna get mixed up in the crossfire here. You're just standing on the fence, you won't take either side here. That's right. When you talk about the chosen people, my name is Brian Borenstein, right? Nobody, God doesn't say Brian Borenstein, you're chosen. Jews don't believe that we're the chosen people. Doesn't say that anywhere in the Jewish scriptures. God offered the Bible to everybody, everybody said no. The Jews are the choosing people. He dropped all his toys off SpongeBob. We chose God, and then he chose us for a set of responsibilities. But no Jew would ever say that we're better than anybody else. We don't believe we're, by the way, it does say that we are a priestly. If you keep the commandments, you would be above all nations. It says that we are a priestly nation and a light unto the nations. Does the Bible say, does God say, if you keep the commandments, you would be above all nations? No, not. Fungal. It don't say that? What are you saying? In Deuteronomy 28 and one, it says, if you observe and keep the law, statute, commandments, you would be above all nations on the earth. That's what it says. The way that you're espousing it, contextually, what it sounds like, is that you're saying that we will rule over people. I didn't even get to rule in part. But am I correct with above? You're talking about yourself. I'm asking him. I'm not talking about myself. Certain understandings can be misconstrued. Wait, before you say that, I just wanna say one. Just to finish really quick, so something like that. I'm trying to free his mind. I need to free his mind. Give me what? So basically. My mind? No. His mind. Eat a mite. There are different, you can look up to someone. So if somebody is someone who you wanna strive to be your parent, your father, your god, you look up to them. So we are a light above the nations. We strive to be unto the nations. We strive to be good people so people could look up. Oh, we would like to be like them. But here's what I'm saying. What I said I wanted to free your mind, I'm not talking about me. Sometimes when you have conversations with scriptures, I'm only talking about the scriptures. That's why I say did God say? I didn't say did I say. So in Deuteronomy 28 and one, it says if you keep these commandments, you would be above all nations on the earth. Now when you go to later verses like Isaiah 49, which I believe you're alluding to with the whole life thing, which I would probably disagree there, but I get that part. But that verse, God clearly says, you'll be above. But what's also wrong with us? Don't beat my blocks. Why can't we both agree? Don't what? We can disagree. No, no, I'm not saying that. I'll leave it in, because I feel bad about the whole situation. It says above, right? Not exactly. But with everything there are in the earth. I just don't do repeat guess. I have to bring in some new people. That's why I'm saying that. Now here's what comes. That would have been messed up because I wanna help you with more of your special. Here's where the above comes into play. There's an above, like the Bible proverb says, when the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice. When the wicked are in authority, the people mourn. I can hear it. I think it's being sold to me now. So there's an above that can bring about a tyrannical type of rule. It's email. Salute your God and the other management. Where it's painful, where it's slavery, et cetera like that. Like what you might see. Are you gonna get messages from your agents about this? And then there's a righteous way to rule where it's not tyrannical. It's not slavery. So y'all ruling with slavery. When Israelites rule, it won't be like that. That's the difference because Jewish people had a hand in slavery too. So did black people. Oh my God. Africans did. Africans did. Africans did. I agree. Listen, no white man went into a village. Africans brought them to the white man. I don't argue that. Like I'm an honest historian. I ain't got to lie about it. He's an honest historian. You're talking to a woman. I'm saying there were, unfortunately, there were Jews involved, but it wasn't even Jewish. Yeah. You insurance companies, the ships. You know why insurance companies started? Because slaves was cargo and they wanted to get paid if any of them slaves died on the way. Why would you want to pay for one of them if you don't receive it? So you got banks. You pay for an Amazon package if you don't get it at your door. In North Carolina, one of the first Jewish slave masters was in North Carolina. Y'all was there too. That's why, you know what tripped me out? When white people want to be separate from Jewish people, y'all the same white man. The same. Y'all just the crime de la crime of that white man. First of all, I'm not saying you are racist, but man, the way you talk is crazy. I do appreciate you looking up to us. I appreciate the crime de la crime. No, y'all the crime de la crime of your white tribes, is what I'm saying. First of all, what people do now, for example, in Israel, is they're equating Israelis to the way that people want to put down white people in America. And they're saying that the Israelis and the Palestinians are like the poor brown people being oppressed. If you went to Israel, you'd notice that most people who live in Israel migrated, right? There are people who are indigenous that we could trace back for thousands of years. And there are people who moved from Iran, Saudi Arabia. To say that Israelis are just the white strongman. Israelis like him, you're saying? It's just a pure lack of knowledge. But you don't use that term with you? Israelis, not Israelis. It just seems like a lot of angst and dislike toward other people coming from you, as opposed to if you're saying that you are representing God, wouldn't that be more about inclusivity? Not we're just- You know, telling the truth is- No, it's- I'm talking about good things. Everywhere in the Torah, when it talks about, whenever God talks about people, there's a beautiful love between people. The utopian world, the Messianic era, the Messianic era, if you want to know the Messianic prophecies, for example, look at Ezekiel chapter 37, the Valley of the Dry Bones. Right. Right, you'll see the Messianic prophecies. But what are the things that you'll see? You'll see universal peace on earth. You'll see universal knowledge of God. We're talking about- Not without war first though. Well, how it comes about is a debate. With war first. Is a debate. There are different opinions. One opinion is it's you against your own ego and overcoming your ego because the most bad things come from the ego. There are different interpretations of things. But when you look at things in terms of the Messianic era and things like this, it's all about peace, love, where Jewish people, people of all faiths, atheists, Muslims, Christians, we're all gonna get along. It's gonna be beautiful. There's something called the uncomfortable truth, right? And so I know why when I'm saying the things that I'm saying and you say it comes across as racist because- Hold on, I wanna move to the next topic. Can I get 20 seconds? No, it's okay. Damn, that's messed up. But he's the white moderator? He's the boss. I am, by the way, if you wanna promote for black power and I can't do white power- No, I ain't said black power the whole time. By the way, Sal is- You can say white power. I mean, we've heard it for hundreds of years. Go ahead, Sal. What's that? Wait for me. What is that? White power. You know, I wanna be a good guest, okay? But I- It won't bother me, Sal. It won't bother me. I ain't saying that for you to say it, but I won't be bothering you. Sorry, I'm not gonna say that at all. Appreciate it. Said my name perfectly, Tzariah. Tzariah. Tzariah. Tzariah Sal. What is it? I don't know what that is. Bravo? I don't know what that is. Anyways, I wanna do a little thing at the table here. Maybe it'll get us all on the same side. We'll start with Sal, then we'll go to you, then we'll go to you guys. Rank all of the races from worst to best. Starting with Sal. I'll actually answer as well after the Jews. Number one would be the human race. No, not a fucking cop out. You call it cop outs, this is where my stance is. That's your true stance, the human race? I don't know what you're saying. Go a little deeper into that, then. Listen, I'm giving you, you know, I'm giving you, I'm speaking my truth here. Like, this is what I believe. Okay, fine. Now you. I'm gonna say the Jewish tribe, then the rest of his either my old American brothers. They're all tied. Yeah, that's one A, one B. So you. That's why I say tribe, because they're the same race. So you think that like a white person from Spain to you is the same as a Chinese guy? No, I don't think I would look at them the same. No, same level of ranking from races. Not like they're the same. No, because the Chinese have, even, well, the Chinese are the worst, you're saying. So if he's living in Spain, I couldn't rank him because I don't have no interaction in America. I'm ranking primarily from America. No, I'm saying the whole world here. If I was to do the whole world, I would do like Silent, just say the humans. Okay, what about you guys? Let them race. Was that a pun or something? Crack a pool cue, throw in the middle, let them fight it out. Can you shoot? I'd rather do the pool cue. What about you? Can I shoot? Shoot pool cue. Rabbi, with the mini hat. Okay. I shot pool last Saturday. I won six straight. I only got off the table because I was going somewhere else. So you're a shark. No, I hadn't shot in a while, but it started feeling good when I was shooting. We should all go play pool together after this. We just celebrated the Jewish New Year Rosh Hashanah, and there's not one prayer in all of Rosh Hashanah about the Jewish people. Everything, it's about the creation of Adam, the man. It's about human race, all of us equally. Rosh Hashanah is all about humanity. You go to a Christian Judaism or something? No, I'm a traditional Orthodox Jewish rabbi. And we're all equal. Rabs. That's right, they call me Rabs. That's right, that's right. Rabs, like short for rabbi. This is better than I thought. I imagine everybody here thought it would be on serious. No, I think it's been a little bit of both. Serious, funny. Serious, serious. Just wanted to make sure to do the best available possible promo for Sal and his upcoming movie. What movie you guys coming up, Sal? Now I have a new talk show going out called Manouche. It'll be on YouTube and wherever you get podcasts. It's coming out late fall, early winter. Oh, you should bring me on, Sal. Manouche, really, really big guest, really small talk. It's gonna be a lot of fun, check that out. I'm on tour. He wants to go on, Sal. Salvocanocomedy.com for tickets. I'm playing the Chicago Theater November 14th, the Beacon Theater New York December 27th. I'm playing the Ryman Theater in Nashville April 12th. I got like 40 cities up. I'm always adding cities, so please check back there. I got season 12 of my television show airing right now on TBS. And my special, Terrified, is currently streaming on HBO Max. Sal, you gonna bring him on your talk show? I'd love to have him. Thank you, Sal. Yeah. Appreciate that. I will donate $2,000 to charity, 1,000. I don't wanna do two. I'll donate $100 to charity if you bring him on your talk show. He's welcome to come on the show. $100 straight to charity. I'll make you that deal. Okay. Is that a real watch? Yeah, this is a Baloba, I don't know how to say it. You're white, I know you know how to say it. What did you say, a Baloba? Yeah, how do you say that? You can read, right? Baloba? Yeah. How did you get another B in there? I'm telling you, it's because it's not like Ebonics. What B? It's only one B. What are you talking about? You said Baloba. I said, I don't know how to say it, and I said you say it, because you know how to speak English. That's correct. You would have been able to read it if it was in like little funny pictures with the guy in his spear. Maybe. Okay. Let me find another story. I don't mean, now I gotta put my watch back to the right time. Sal doesn't believe in systemic racism. Go ahead. Anybody can join in on this one. Why not Sal? What? What's up with that? How did you say that word again? Systemic. Oh, okay. He said it better the second time. First time you said it, fuck that. Fuck that. As Sal's Rabbi, I'm advising him not to answer this question. Well, where did you get that from? Did I state that? I don't know where you pulled that from. That's one of the things you said on your new thing you're doing. So I got to see it before it released. Manouche, my new talk show? Something like that. The one that's gonna be out late fall, early winter on YouTube. Yeah, I got shown something, and if you're talking to an Israelite, I don't believe in systemic racism. Wherever I can find my podcasts. Yes, that's correct. I didn't say that. You're misquoting me. Anyways, just join in on the debate. Discuss your thought process on that, Sal. By the way, I agree with you. What do you think? I don't believe in systemic racism. You don't? No. Okay. Fucking look at Obama. What about him? Why you look at me when you said Obama? Because you're black. But Obama's African, though. To me, you know, I'm not, I don't believe in the funny stuff where like you say all the people in the world are black. I can't help it if your education ain't up there yet. You're creating your own education. It's not our own education. And by the way, I think the reason you're confused is because you don't really know how to read English words. You read pictures and you're misquoting me. Whether I know how to read or not, I know every dark skinned race is not the same people. You know every dark skinned race is not the same people. Are East Indians black? Are East Indians African? I like the way you pronounce people. You literally are putting all white people together. It's like literally what you're doing. He's pissed right now. Sal, he's fucking crazy. Literally what you just did. He just got served. No, he's pissed. Me and Sal are the same. I can't help it if there's more melanated ethnicities than they are than your singular non-melanated ethnicity. What? I've never been called a non-Jew before, but he said that I look like Sal, so I'm actually like kind of flattered. Josh. I always wanted to look Italian. That's your brother, man. I always wanted to look half Italian. You almost home. Can I recommend the conditioner? Why, how are you getting like an ophro? No, I just got something. You got a good sister, you got a good sister, you got a good sister. You're a little less frizzy, and then you have more control. I noticed you're fiddling with it a lot. Because when I'm getting sweaty, my hair is absorbing it, and it turns into sort of like his style thing. Braids? No, your hair. Like an afro style. I'm saying your people. Hey, I sell this hair tonic. It could help you. I don't use... I have a business. Try it. I have a very lucrative business. You sell like potions and wizarding stuff? No, it's a hair tonic that I make. It's a mixture. You made it? It'll help. Yeah, I made it myself. Oh no, go ahead. That is fucked up. You check out my reviews, they're insane, man. Everybody. Listen, even though I had a white lady, I had a white lady message me, she had this bad skin thing. Skin plop. And then she used your thing in her hand. And she asked me, so I made her unscented body butter, put some witch hazel on it. Witch hazel? Witch hazel. Cleaned it all up. That's great for bug bites. Witch hazel. Witch hazel. Oh yeah, it targets the itch. And I sell her body butter. And when she put the body butter, it helped her. See, I even help white people with their skin problem. See that? I can't be racist. That is how racism works, if you create body butter. That's right. That's why I have... That's my new thing. I'm gonna just use body butter. Yeah, body butter, man. Listen, go to car.com. You can check it out. Uh-uh, no self promo. Black Jews. We help Sal promote everything. That's the only promotion. Black Jew. I should be K. Dot com. Black Jew. Watch your advice so Sal can become less racist. Sal's not racist at all. No, that's what he said on his new program or whatever. I would probably have to hear it. When you're on the internet, there's a thing called... You should have heard it when I was walking him in the building. What did he say? Fuckin' I hope there's no fucking black people in there. That's what he was telling me in my ear, but he was saying it wrong. Well, you know what it seemed like? It seemed like when he got around a black guy, he changed. That didn't say anything. Because he's scared of you. You're dangerous looking. You might have a weapon. No, not in Cali. Uh-uh. See, you would have had a weapon. Yeah, but come on. It's not about licensing with you. Why? We obey the law. We don't break the law. All right. Yeah, listen, I follow the law. Now, if I had a license to carry, then maybe it'd be different. I mean... Anybody in here got a license to carry? No. No. If you're going to Chicago, you should look into it. Cali's strict with that? We get to carry the Torah. But by the way, I don't know if you thought about this, but you could maybe mail Sal some of the body butters to help with his racism and eczema. Yeah, mine's helped with eczema too, because one of my sons had it. Put their body butter on it. Once you're dealing with racism, I'd have all deal with the eczema. Just get it crystal. This is a very general... But Sal is clean. This is a very general question. Anybody can answer it. Actually, no, we'll start with Sal, then we'll go this time to you guys and then to the black guy. Jewish. Think whatever he is. It's confusing. Put me last. You don't understand. Put me last, right? I would like you to make the most convincing argument on why you think the other is wrong. The other? Yes. The other who? Him. You initially debated him at the beginning, so you'll start with him. Yeah, you know, the debate was short-lived and I didn't think we really bumped heads on anything. I just kind of... Make your best argument, but you've heard him talk a lot since then. You agree with everything he said? Wave up, yeah? I would say this. I would say to every point there is a counterpoint. So make your best counterpoint to anything he said so far. I'm fine with him believing what he wants to believe. That's his prerogative. You know, I might not agree with it, but... Yeah, but that's sort of the idea of it. You don't agree with it, so you're going to say you're a reason why you don't agree with it. Format it the best way you can. Yeah, I mean, like I said earlier, I'm not particularly religious. That's your argument? Well, I really don't know. They're both very well-versed in what they're talking about. I'm not. I think I would not add to this debate or conversation. And so how can I debate him if I don't really... If I can't back up anything, I can't fact-check him and I don't know anything, I'm not really part of it. You know what I'm saying? I think you know what I'm saying here. It's like, what have I really added here except a warm body? You drank all the juice, you ate all the bread. I didn't even eat or drink anything. I offered you multiple times. I tried to promote my show a few times. You told me you were going to beep it. I came here in good faith, pun intended. I've had white people for the record. Was that him? I don't even know what he's talking about. You know what I'm saying? It's like, give me something that I have some education on and maybe I can impart my thoughts. I know you want more than this from me and I want to give you more, but it just seems illogical for me to dispute anything that was said here because I am not someone in a position to speak to it. I started doing my show. You're just trying to confuse me and get out of it. You think that was confusing? Well, you're saying, oh, I really don't know anything and if I said anything, it would be ignorant. I'm not going to say anything. My name is Sal and I have a promo to do. What do you want me to say? Say what you told me about him before you got here. Say it to his face. That's right. Say it to his face. Say it to his face. You know, when we decided I would do the pod, it wasn't expectedness. It's really been something. I just, as I said, I don't do episodes where the guest comes back. I get it. However, I have to applaud the creativity. I think you should come back a lot. You think I'm going to come back a third time? I think we can do various styles of this show in the future. Okay, so what you're saying is you don't do repeat guests, but this can be a new thing. This can be like a special segment. I think you can go back more and more. Every single time you mix it up and it's something you haven't done before. I'll make it something brand new. I had a nice time. At times, was I uncomfortable? Yes. Was I uncomfortable the entire time? Yes. But I like doing things that put me in new scenarios. I like keeping myself on my toes. I'm going to do a couple dozen of these. Maybe they'll go fantastic just like this every time. Maybe I'll have a flourishing promotional avenue here. I know this is going to sell tickets for me. This here, me here today is going to sell. My tour is going to thrive. Your tour is going to blow up. What's that? Your tour is going to blow up. Metaphorically, it's going to blow up. I think to make a counterpoint, him and his group, I can imagine a lot of them are in that theater you're performing at. I'm sure you'll sell a lot more tickets there. That would be great. Please come bring friends. Let's be real. If you came and did a show and it was just people like him, not like Black, just people who were dressed funny like this, you'd be a little scared. Why? I want to give you something, but I can't agree with you. When he does his show, we would come to his show and necessarily dress like this. I don't dress like this every day. I didn't tell you to dress like that. I didn't say you did, but I dress like this when it's appropriate. When it's raining. So the book of Ezekiel only applies when you're teaching? What book? You said what you read. I read that because it's in the Bible. So it only applies when you teach? If I go to the gym, I'm not wearing this when I'm going to the gym. So the Bible says on condition that that's when you wear it? No, the Bible says when you're reading the scriptures or praying, you would have this on. But it doesn't say when you're working a job that you have to have this on. Now I know you need another book to understand that. I don't need no heads up on this one. I don't give anybody a heads up. I thought you would. Which podcast did you enjoy more out of the two? Not really, just ignoring the ridiculousness of that ridiculous event. Last time I was attacked. That's true actually, I forgot about that. But if he was standing right here again and he got you again. Don't think I didn't think about it. That would have been pretty cool. That shit is bland and not biblical. It's old school. But not old old school. That shit is bland and not biblical. Anyways, go ahead and make your best argument against him. In general, anything, about anything. Don't compliment him. No, he's doing like one of them steps. No, it has to be against him. I'm not asking you to win a debate against him. I'm asking you to do your best point against him. You don't have to fluff it with him. He's a nice guy, he made nice points. Just go straight to the jugular. So straight to the jugular, he made one of my hat off the bat. He understood it once I said it. No matter what points he brought across, he went for the hat. And I feel like that was just a low blow. You shouldn't have to go for the hat. If you have real points, don't mess with him. Literally for your hat? He went for my hat. Me? No, you know better. You know better than that. I already made fun of your hat. I did it before him. I want some credit on that. I think it looks ridiculous too. Oh no. Let's play the tape. I think that looks just as ridiculous. You have a lion on your face. That's right. It's fake diamonds. I'm a lion. No, you're out of your mind. I am out of my mind. The prophets in the Bible were considered out of their mind too. Look what they did. No, you're not getting it. You're not a prophet in the Bible. I'm a prophet now. You named yourself captain and you can't even swim. I didn't name myself captain. I was given that title. You were given that title by who? By the man that outranks me, Commander John Yohanna. Commander John Yohanna? I tried to hold it in that time. Do you believe you're actually a prophet? Yeah, priest, prophet, I'm the most high. This guy's ridiculous. But that's what I'm saying. It's funny to have somebody here. That's what they said about all the prophets. This is a lovely chambray. What about my scene here? It looks good? Yeah, I mean I'll give you credit for sitting with that through the indoors. Because that's what I'm talking about. It's like a nice merino wool. This is just a business side of things. Is it breathable? Or are you cooking under there? It's hot under here, but now I look serious. Everybody knows to take me seriously. You didn't come to play no game. Yeah. Right. Did you answer yet against his thing? I think you didn't get a word in the Bible. Honestly, the truth is I think that he's sincere about what he believes. No compliments. Just do the argument. There's not one. The best one. The biggest one. I think of a nature of being divisive as opposed to unifying would be the one that I would flock onto in terms of being above other people. Who are you talking about? Sal or the guy here? We'll skip Sal for now. But Sal was pretty tough to listen. Look, this is about a real argument. Sal, look, this is about a belief, not about the person. And I think there are a lot of things I disagree with, practically everything that he said. But that being said, if I'm going to harp on one, it'll be about the interpersonal relationships with other people. God cares a lot more about how we are with each other than him. Doesn't care about how we are with him as much as he cares about how we are with each other. So anything that promotes divisiveness as opposed to unity, I'm going to be against that. Now you. The biggest argument that I had, well, I don't have no issue with Sal at all. Nothing with Sal? Not one thing. He escaped with no damage. I wouldn't say escape, but for somebody that was, what is the word, derailed from what he thought he was, I thought he handled himself well, so I don't have no issue. I didn't know what I was walking into. Right, right, he was just three hours. And I don't have a personal issue with nobody. These are just discussions. We have to be men when you have conversations. Sometimes the truth hurts. The biggest argument is when he said that God can't give him the understanding of the Torah, he needs another book to understand that. That is diabolical because God gave the children of Israel. You heard that? God gave the children of Israel one book. That's the book they read, and that's the book they understood. And that's where he separated the difference between the men and the boys. That's the biggest argument that I got. You a little kid. What he said. He a grown man. Okay, let's continue. Do we have time to put money in the meter? Always about money. Definitely Jewish. No doubt about it. No. You like three for three, back to back to back. Yeah, but the other two were insulting you, you know that, right? No. You were insulting your way of speaking and saying it sounded funny basically. Not the last two pumps. When I said you were a grown man, you think I was serious? Yes. That thing like stopping the blood from going to your brain? It flows real good. It's fly too. Can I see it? No. Can I wear it? No. Why? Because you're not an Israelite. So what, I can't wear it because I'm not an Israelite? That's right. What if I agree to become one? You can't agree to become one. You're born one. What if he gives you some money? You didn't even gave up your own culture. What about where it talks about conversion? What about where the Bible talks about conversion? There's no such thing as them being converted and being the way of my headpiece. Anybody, the better word. Would you let Sal wear it? Sal says he's Italian so he would be white too so he couldn't wear it. But I wouldn't use the word conversion but I would use the word citizen. So if someone was living in our city, we wouldn't mistreat them. It's not about bullying another ethnicity because they're not my race of people. I would deal with them fair. But there's certain rules that makes Israelites separate. The Bible very clearly says... Like if you lend money to a non-Israelite, you can charge him interest. But if you lend money to an Israelite, you cannot charge him interest. That's how you act? That's not how I'm acting. That is true. And it also says that when you have... Specifically it says these three people. It says the convert, the orphan, and the widow. Orphan and the widow could be an Israelite too. I'm not speaking with converts or citizens. It don't say convert in the Bible. That's why citizen is better. If a stranger that's a non-Israelite lives amongst us, they would have the same rights as us. But there's certain things like every Israelite is not a priest. So every Israelite wouldn't wear an Israelite garment. That's true. Every convert is an Israelite. It would be an Israelite, not a Levite or a priest. That's true. So you're wearing that because you're priestly. That makes more sense. That's what I was saying. But a convert, you do agree that converts can join? If a citizen... Excuse me. Let's say if an Ishmaelite is living in the land of Israel under our rule, they would follow the Torah, they would follow the laws, they would do everything like us. They would be a citizen, no different than us. They would still be an Ishmaelite. They would just be like a citizen. Like when Elon Musk, who's South African, comes to America, he's an American citizen, but he's still South African. South Africa is the best country in Africa. Do you actually keep the Torah? Do you keep the Sabbath? Yes. I keep the Sabbath. We just did Day of Atonement. We did Feast Day last Sunday, this past Sunday. So when it says to afflict your souls on the Day of Atonement, Ryan Yom Kippur, so how do you afflict your soul? We fast. Why? I mean it says it's a day of affliction. How do you know how to afflict your soul without an interpretation? Because you see Daniel doing the same thing. We fast, no food. Daniel? How do you keep the Sabbath? How do you kill an animal before you do it? The Sabbath is very simple. You don't do no servile work. So on a Sabbath day, whatever your job is, you don't do that on your day. In Hebrew, it's interesting. In Hebrew, there are two words for work. One is avoda, one is malacha. Avoda is like you go to your job. It doesn't say that. It says malacha. It's a different type of work. It's a creative type of work. If I wanted to be a waiter on the Sabbath as an orthodox Jew, I could be. So what can you do on the Sabbath? There are 39 categories of law that I cannot do. Jesus Christ, that's on the Talmud, right? No. No. So wait. There are two definitions of work. Two words, avoda and malacha. Avoda, if I wanted to be a waiter, somebody wanted to pay me money to be a waiter on the Sabbath, I could be a waiter at a bar mitzvah, for example. But I couldn't use an eraser. I couldn't take a pen and write because there are 39 actions of creativity that God somehow Yeah, that's something that you're getting out of the Talmud. It's just simpler than that for us. Okay. If you was my boss on the Sabbath, I don't work for you on that day. That's my day to do what I want. That's what the Sabbath was made for, to rest from your labor. Is that simple? That's how simple that is. And they gave y'all all the bread, didn't they? We got the bread. Well, he kept taking it. I was just trying to be nice. No, no, I'm not complaining about it. You want the bread? No, no, no. I don't want none of the bread. I just said I didn't. It's gonna sit there. Look down, look down, look down, look down, look down. Well, that's all the time we have. We're gonna have to end it here because I'll have to do my next episode. It'll be an actual fight. It won't be a debate. Well, it'll be a debate, but like a real fight between Long Neck and you, if you're willing to join, or I'll find somebody else. I don't know who Long Neck is. He's that little scrawny piece of shit. He has a big neck. It's in the name. I don't know. I'll even let you use that weapon against him. You could take it off. Can I touch it? No. I'm not allowed to touch it? No. I just want to feel what it's made out of. No. Maybe when, maybe. Can I touch it? Can I touch it? Sure. My name is Brian Borenstein. I'm in charge of, I work for the Orthodox Union, and I'm the West Coast Regional Director for NCSY, which is the high school programming. And I'm an Orthodox Rabbi out here in Los Angeles. Sal, go ahead. Actually, we'll do Sal last. Now you go Rabbi, whatever. Go Rabbi. My name is Menachem Silverstein. I'm a rabbi and comedian. See me at the Laugh Hactor every Thursday at 10 p.m. Okay, go ahead. I'm Captain Tzariach of ISUP King's College. I'm Tzariach of ISUPK under Commander General Yohanna. I'm a priest and prophet. You have to admit, your guys' names are very funny. Our names are fire. You just ain't never heard them before. Just like nobody heard your language before that you speak, and you got accustomed to your words. What I'm speaking is pretty clear. And nobody ever heard your names. You never heard somebody named Bread and Water. That would be a ridiculous name. This guy's not serious. Hey, that's unique, man. How did you get that name? Oh, nice to meet you, Bread and Water. Like that. But when you got my name, you say, hey, come on, man, let's do this show. See that? See how it works. Not because of your name. I needed somebody here to debate the Jews and Sal. Well, mostly Sal. Sal, go ahead. Now it's your turn. My name is Sal Vulcano. I'm a stand-up comedian and a producer and a writer and stuff like that. I have a tour. It's called the Everything's Fine Tour. It's a brand new hour of material. If you see my special, Terrified Streaming on H2O Max, it's a brand new hour. And you can get tickets at SalVulcanoComedy.com. I'm touring all the way through 2026. I'm always adding dates and cities. Got a new talk show called Minouche coming out toward the end of the year. And season 12 of Impractical Jokers is now airing on TBS. And let's be fair and give Sal some credit. Because truly, he did know what was happening today. And a lot of comedians wouldn't agree to something like this. They would want to stay safe while Sal was willing to get in the middle of this heated debate. I am known for being very edgy. Right. Good job, Sal. Okay, well, that's it. We're done. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you guys. Have fun, Sal.
