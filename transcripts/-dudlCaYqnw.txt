Those audio listeners you didn't see that but K-Rob's clappers went crazy and I'm not talking about his back end. Go Peta, go Peta, go Peta, go Peta. Co-host Cam's back in the studio. Peta Weida back in the studio. Did you get a haircut? I did get a haircut. It's always refreshing. It really is. I really look not like good without a haircut. No. That's just honest truth. Honestly, it's like refreshing to see like you like because whenever you don't have a haircut I'm like I don't even know if I want to be around him too much. Check his history. Definitely lock your car if he walks by. And I go maybe having a child is not the right thing to do when you don't have a haircut. But then whenever you get this haircut it's like oh there we go. There's an average looking white man. There is a soul in that body. An average looking white man. No, no. Now you know I am past average not due to looks. I might be ugly to some. I am past average due to one thing. One thing only. Not height. Personality. Not personality. That definitely ascends me into the greats. Money? Definitely not that either. Not talking about that. My hairline for a soul that comes from the Slavic region is undefeated. It's so good. It's really good. It's the only time I really pop my own stuff. But yeah it's straight as an arrow. I don't know where I got it from because no one at my mom's... Your mom's got a hook chopped on the hairline? My mom's got a little hook going on there with a little widow's peak. Oh yeah. Isn't widow's peak a sign of Satan? What? I didn't know that. No. You're saying if someone has a widow's peak. Yeah. There's Satan. I'm pretty sure because I had a widow's peak when I was growing up. And I think they were like telling me something. I think they were trying to bully me. I'm not quite sure. The fact that you think growing up your hairline was a widow's peak that receded very deep. No no it doesn't recede. It was like I had a normal hairline but then the point just had like a little airplane at the tip of it. Like it was like a little triangle like right there in the middle of my forehead. Yeah. I had that for a long time. I don't know what happened to it. I was about to say how does one get rid of that? I think straight stress. I'm currently making myself bald. One because I always wear a hat for no reason. And then two is I am so stressed out. And like not only are years coming off my life, hairs coming off my head. We are. Okay now Koala family and regular Yushino family. We are working on one and two. We're trying to work on the not wearing a hat every day. We've been trying to work on slow little jabs. Well one of my barbers is inconsistent. He's having a second kid so he's fired definitely. And the second one he's just far and he got in a car wreck and so he won't drive to my house anymore. So I'm honestly just waiting on things to clear up in the schedule and then we're going to get back to normal. That is crazy. Because this man is expanding his family and this man got in a very bad car wreck that you are just not going to get your hair cut and you're just going to put a hat on. We are in Dallas. There's millions of people here. There's at least 12 other options in that very shop. And you're just like no one's touching my head. It's really weird. Okay but you brought this up. You talked highly about yourself which is surprising. I wish I had that confidence. I'd be a billionaire. Dude you're in progression. You've always been very, you have like a nice just popping jab. Like a little snapping jab. Your **** is lightning quick. My jab can make you fall asleep. Your quick wittedness has gone above and beyond. Okay but since you're delusional, honestly, let's be frank here. I'll give an answer too. One through ten, I think I've asked you this before but life's gone on and you should be more realistic. What would you rate yourself looks wise one through ten? Looks wise? Yes just straight optics. No straight optics. We see Cam walking into a bar. A big ginger, big hip **** walking into a bar. A big hip **** ginger **** ginger is walking into a bar. Sounds like a start of a bad joke. I would say optically not hearing my voice, nothing. Optically I believe and I think it's alright to believe that I am of three. No I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Beauty's an eye of the beholder. I would unbiasedly put myself slightly above average and I'd park me at about a seven five. That's right park. You're a Helen Keller ten. Let me say that. I mean. That's so **** up but it's so true. Dog if I had... Oh put that camera away. Oh dude if I... Oh I'm a Helen Keller twelve. I got a nice soft heart. I will take care of you. I mean. That's why you spend so much time in the nursing homes. They're like you're so beautiful honey. Wow honey you're so beautiful. **** is a confidence booster. That's the only place I get my ego stroked is around a nursing home. People can't see me. Yeah. Okay same question. Optically what are you? Straight optics. No personality. No little weird quirks. I honestly think I'm the worst version of myself right now. Optically. Dude did you just shake your head CJ? CJ just went like this. Yeah pretty much. But why do you think that's not true? Honestly I'm starting to look like melted candle wax. No no. Like it looks like my face is dripping. Like every day. Every day my face sinks. You know what I mean? That's not true. Yeah. You have a bruised ego mirror. You look in the mirror and you just see the negatives. If we were to describe you you'd be straight positivity. I'd go he's tall, dark, nice little chunk of caramel chocolate. Thank you. Nice. He's big boned. You know he's got cool clothes and he's probably going to smell great. He's a great looking guy. You're like I'm drooping, I'm a melted candle, my hair's receding. But the thing is I don't like is my family bro. Like I try to. Now that's brutal honesty. No no but it's not. My mom is not honest with me. She's one of those moms that will lie to me and I don't appreciate it. I'm almost 30. I know me better than that. I know me. I'm not a little boy. And I was telling her because I'm in this weight loss journey right and I was like I'm thick bro. And she was like oh babe it's just baby weight. I'm almost 30 mom. If there was a world war I am eligible to be drafted. I am a man. A man. Baby weight at 26. Baby weight at 26 is a, I feel like that can only come from a mom. That is the epitome of a motherly lie.

The You Should Know Podcast. You brought up calorie counting. Do you know, because now I am, you went cold turkey straight to it. I started, I did four days strong, slipped at the weekend. My hardest thing right now is weekends with family and shit like that. But try it again this past week. I went Monday through Thursday, solid. Do you know how embarrassing it is as a 27 year old man to drive through a Sonic and order a wacky pack? A what? Now that might be a racial slur. No it's not. A wacky pack? Stop saying it. That's not a racial slur. Oh my god there's a Twitter hashtag camps canceled. That's not a, no you are blowing this up for no, a wacky pack. Stop saying it. That is the kids meal that's no different than a happy meal. Sonic's is called a wacky pack. A kids meal? At Sonic is called a wacky pack. Okay so how do you order going through Sonic? I literally drove up, they said hey what can I get you? I said let me get the chicken tender wacky pack. And I, as a 27 year old grown ass man, I had to order a chicken tender wacky pack because that's the only thing on the menu that sufficed my caloric allowance. I imagine them like roller skating up to your window and they're like oh there's going to be a kid I get to say hi to and like waiting to give a toy it's just big ass camp. Oh yeah they see a sweaty guy in a rental Malibu and I'm like this. Like gimme, gimme the wacky pack. The fat dude they asked do I want a boy or girl toy? What'd you say? I am a 27 year old man. I literally said I don't really need a toy man and it was a guy too. I don't really need a toy bro. Oh like what does the kid want? I don't need the toy in the pack. I don't need, just gimme the wacky pack. Sure it's policy. It comes with the meal. I said you surprised me then bro. I don't care just put whatever toy you want in there. Was it a good toy? It was a boy toy. Gave it to Malachi. My son didn't even like it. So it's like Sonic your toys suck. Let's just start there. It was honestly a hit having to order a wacky pack. That is, and I don't know, it makes me think about this journey man. It's honestly so hard. It is. Your discipline is out of this world. Yeah it's all my big bone people. I get why you're that way. No and I'm not, no no no no no no no no no no no no I didn't mean it like that. I appreciate everybody. I'm with you. I'm close to exiting. You said you'd get me for wacky pack? No I'm on the way of exiting. He said hey bigans I get it now. What? No look I'm not, I like big people. No dude you're dakin. No hey just drop the shovel. I'm in the same group as you. In my chart they said I was overweight so I'm in your thing. You just called them overweight. You are. That's not a problem I am too. But I'm close to getting out but I'm in there with you. Look we're all in prison together right? We're all in prison. I only had a two month sentence. You're in there for life. You got convicted like K-Rob of a petty crime. You're going for three months. Now why K-Rob? Because he's literally facing a federal sentence right now. That's not true. K-Rob's going to jail for 90 days. Why are you so bold people that? I'm sorry Bubba I'm sorry. I'm just kidding. It's a comedy podcast. It's going to get clipped or whatever. It sucks ordering a wacky pack because it's a 27 year old. It's not for my kid and I don't care about the toy and it was too chicken. I hate to go back. I hate to go back. But another reason why I think I'm unattractive is because I'm used to like whenever I was young and hot like I would be walking in public and I could tell people looking at me. Always a good feeling. Always like I'd get the looks up and down. I would get the little tap look at this guy like I felt like Marlon. I felt like him. You know what I mean? I've never looked that good. Can I say something about Marlon? Let's just talk about him. He's the hottest guy I've ever seen. Like literally the hottest guy on earth. If you don't know who Marlon is, he's a Twitch streamer. I would lick ice cream off his chest. Now we're going to a place that I'm not going to go with. Like imagine like a little bit of fondue. Like a fondue found at Golden Corral. The bottom of it's Marlon. We're definitely going to run into him in public. It's kind of weird that you just set that precedent. You're going to see him and he now through internet might say you said you wanted to lick my chest. No, I didn't say I want to. I would though. Like I'm saying like I would understand. I understand the appeal. Oh, like if it came down to it. Oh, oh yeah. Oh, someone's like, hey, you got to do that right now. You have no problem. Yeah, no, this is how it goes. Ask me to do it. Hey, you got to do you want to lick fondue off my chest? I'm Marlon. No. You sure? Yeah, I want to. That's all it is. That's all it is. It just takes one more. I literally just said, you sure you go? Yeah, come on. That's all it takes. Oh, especially especially because you're looking at me and you said it the second one. I guarantee you staring at the man that you're willing to lick. My pants are hot. Have we seen Marlon? Oh, I'm confident in myself. Hey, you know, OK, so you know those. I didn't get to my thing. But go ahead. Oh, I know. I know my score would be low too. There's accounts on TikTok that their whole thing, they're like graphic designers. They have a software or whatever. And there's basically a ratio of like the perfect face. And it's like, oh, I've seen that. His is like pretty close. Yeah, really perfect. There's minimal things they had to do. They'd be like, oh, they'd be dragging the head in a lot. Like, keep going. Come on. Come on. You got it. You got a pencil to bring it in. Yeah. Cheeks. I would be messed up. But his was like pretty close. OK. If I was attractive, I would get stairs and walks and people would come up to me and like hit on me. Right. It was like that's what I knew I was hot. It hasn't happened in forever. Until this week. Oh, oh, hold on. Now, Papa can't get hit on one of Papa P can't hit on. OK, Papa. One of the most confusing slash scary things happened to me this week. Oh, God. 100 percent buckling in 100 percent a true story. And it has bothered me. And I feel like it's going to come out on the Internet. What happened? Like it's going to publicly happen on like it's going to come out. Did you strike someone? No, no, I don't know. Sir, no violence. So this is somebody like hit on me, but I think it's going to be public. OK, now, yeah, you got to start talking. I don't know. I am. I'm I'm now sweating because it's public. Oh, so this Saturday I was walking through the mall by myself. As I am. Right. OK, I'm walking too frequently. Yeah, like you have friends, you have phones, you don't want anyone with you. Oh, I was walking through the mall by myself. Right. And through the rear, a woman comes up right beside me, taps me. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. I look at the woman. Right. Pretty girl. Nice. Right. Pretty girl. Glasses on. Makeup done. Right. No. I don't describe her outfit. And she goes, hey. And I said, hi. She says, hey, sorry to bother you. I need help with directions. And I go, OK, I'll try. Don't don't you act like you have that mall bag like the back of your hand. No, but if you know, be like, you go 700 steps, so you're going to take a sharp right. There's going to be a guy named Ernesto. He's going to offer you a bottle of water. Say no, keep going. No, but if you know me, anytime somebody gives me directions or anytime somebody asks directions from me, I panic and you lie. That's my triggering question. Right. So immediately she asked me, hey, I need help with directions. Panic mode ensues. Oh, my God. I'm not good with directions. Oh, my God. You verbally accosted her. She goes. She goes, I need help with directions. I say, OK, I'll try. She goes, oh, well, like she's confused. She goes, oh, you're not from here. She's aggressive. And I go, no, I am, but I'm horrible at directions. Mm hmm. She humble bag. She replies saying it's OK. I wasn't really looking for physical directions. I was looking for directions to your heart. Oh, my God. Oh, God, I know you were. I and I don't know what like I don't know what my body did, but I looked at I was a couple of steps away. Oh, my God. It was like an impulse step back. Like I went to full defense mode because I'm scared of that. I'm scared of it. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. Can we please? Yeah. She goes, not physical directions, but directions to your heart. You go, oh, you just like, oh, whoa, hold on now. And oh, but my natural thing is because I was really expecting like I was going to have to lie to her and tell her directions. I didn't know the directions. You're discombobulated. Right. And so she hits me with that smoke bomb. And so I'm all disoriented. I think I literally went I think I ought to be who? Because her response was, did that work? Now you put me in a predicament. She does. It was was her name, Steph. Last name, Curry. She is I mean, she is as bold as they come. Did that work? But look. In my position in life, right. My current status. No, ma'am. Yeah. I'm in a situation. Yeah. So I go, oh, I'm sorry. I got a girlfriend. I literally know I feel bad. No, I feel bad. But you should feel good on the same front. No, yes. But I saw her knees buckle. She got two inches shorter because that was a bold thing to say and a bold thing to do. She went, boo, boo. Oh, and God bless you. Due to your mental state of being anxious and now in smoke bombs, you probably know I have a girlfriend. It didn't come off smooth. Right. I don't think it came out smooth. But then she goes, she goes back down to her phone and starts to do something on her phone. And she goes, yeah, it seems like all the attractive ones have girlfriends. And I was like, OK, what are you looking at your phone? Yeah, I was like, what the figure? It's me now. Yes. Why are you looking at your phone? She looks back up at me. She has Ray-Ban like meta glasses on. I think she was recording me. And so now I'm like, oh, I'm going to be on the Internet. So I asked her name. I said, what's your name? And she told me, I said, oh, it's so nice to meet you. Right. Oh, my God. I don't know if she was recording me. I don't want to put that on there. But she 100 percent had the Ray-Ban, the gray band, meta glasses on. See the little LED light indicator? No. So I go back. I go. I continue my shopping after that. I feel bad because I've never rejected somebody before. But, you know, I've never done it. I don't. Well, not because people don't come up to me. Oh, my God. You easy. Hey, you're cute. Come with me. What? You never said no. I was. No, no, it's just because women don't really hit on me. And if they do, I'll just give them a fake number. But in the predicament I am in, I can't even do that. I don't want to do that. Yes. Oh, my. Oh, my God. This is this is incredible. No. OK. But look, it gets crazier. I go up to Zara. Right. I'm in Zara looking at clothes. I'm still trying to reel from what just happened. Like my sorry knees buckling. I physically watched her almost diddy bop. I'm checking out the jackets, right. And from my peripheral, I see a silhouette of a woman walk past. I turned my head to look. The same woman that just asked for my number and I had to reject in front of people was walking right past me, holding hands with a six foot eight NFL looking player. And I literally was like, holy shit. And she kept looking at me like this. My heart, I can't say nothing to him. If I say something to him, he thinks I'm lying. I'm dead. Yeah, you're going through this man. I've ever seen Derek Henry is holding her hand. Right. Oh, terrifying. I continue down the mall. I mind my business. That's nothing to do with me. Right. I leave. I'm like, I want nothing to do with that. I want nothing to do with that. Right. I'm walking through the mall some more. I'm walking out of Lululemon. I'm walking out of Lululemon. Who's standing outside of Lululemon? Derek Henry and the woman. The woman is standing out there, not with the six eight dude I just saw her with. She's talking to a group of four dudes, putting her number in one of their phones. Am I wrong for being jealous now? What? Am I wrong? You are jealous after that? You didn't want just me. I'm not. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, buddy. She wanted anything. She wanted anything in the world that has, you know what it sounds like. But who was holding her hand? That was the next tallest big glass of chocolate milk she could find. Oh, he he he he. Oh, man, there's nothing I got to have your personality. I don't have his. He knows a three point stance and you don't have what? What did you just say? What did you just say? What did you just say? 50% off on royalty. You want to hear what I just said? 50% off all week. That is a I think it's fair to say, a yeah, technically the bullets not dodged. Now, the very incriminating thing, they can't happen. Yeah. Her Ray Ban meta footage hits Internet. You lied about everything. You go, hey, girl, yeah, here's my number. Oh, my gosh. She eyes me. She eyes me. Oh, my God. She eyes me. And I'm literally going this. Oh. Oh, no, she has enough. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, my God. Can you imagine watching that video? She's like, she's like doing she was looking down, scrolling through the phone. She goes, yeah, seems like they all have boy girlfriends looks up. You're like. Oh, my God, that is I mean. Holy I got more stories from that mall trip. That is a lot to unpack. Yeah, it was it was it was one. It is the ego in me that I was jealous because like what the has to be. Yeah, that has to be like what the. I'm not good enough. Just kidding. It's not right to call women that. It's a joke. Oh, I think my I'm telling the line today. I think I think that's fine. I think my greatest takeaway is that you were just the fast thing. Yeah, we just find out. Yeah, you just you just name drop yourself as being a like that. You said I've never said no to a girl. It sounds unbelievable. That sounds crazy, but it's because I rarely get hit on like that. And if I do, I'll just put in a fake number or I go by my alias, which is Steve. So you have we all do know that. Yeah, she goes, I'm at this. He's like six, seven black. His name was Steve, though. That's kind of weird, but I kind of like it, girl. She shows a picture to you like this. Yeah, something. Yeah. You should know podcast. This episode is brought to you by a personal favorite of me and Kamlin's in the YSK pod, it is called Scams. Kim tells about scams. We all already knew that scams was amazing. It was always talked about. But the day we heard scams was making underwear for men. We bout through a party. I'm not going to lie. My wife already had the skin stuff. I always knew it was soft. And now I knew I got to wear it on my undergarments. Fun fact, I got on scams right now. I tell you, I wear this daily. I like it because I can wear it in any environment I want. If I'm working out, which I'm starting to do now. Great for workout. Fantastic. I mean, I'm on I'm on the stair master. I'm on the treadmill. No word about that riding up feeling. And also, if I'm going out right, if I want to put on a little sexy outfit, not only do I look sexy on the outside, skims makes me feel sexy underneath the pants. My personal favorites are the stretch boxer briefs. They're fantastic. You can wear them anywhere just like he said. And it's amazing because you feel comfortable, you feel contained, but you don't feel all crotched up. If you know what I'm saying, I do know what you're saying. Shop skims, men's at skims dot com. Let him know that we sent you. After you place your order, select podcast in the survey and select our show in the drop down menu that follows. Let's see. You should know podcast. We love you. Skims. Thank you. On to the rest of the episode. You should know podcast. So you OK, you said the one guy. This is just from this weekend. You said the one guy what it looked like an NFL player. Yeah. I had a realization that I need to change my ways when it comes to football season. Being a fan of the Dallas Cowboys. And I'm not like it's at a certain point, it's not good for my family. How primal and angry I can become watching the Dallas Cowboys. Dude, watching sports in general, you are. You know, you are a bad person to watch sports with. Now, I know I get heated. I love the basketball is a little different. Yeah, I know all the ins and outs of basketball football. I don't. I love football, but I don't know, like ultra deep dive film. Yeah. You can't tell me what a cover two is. Exactly. Yeah. OK. My God. Yeah. But I'm talking about exact all this other. Right. Watching the game this past Sunday, which we lose to the Bears, which is a joke. I literally caught myself turning around, looking at my son with a face of fear in his eyes. Really? Because I'm sitting there, the TV mother. Like screaming at like somebody. He's just sitting like this. Like he's like like fainting at me. So my wife's getting mad at me. Yeah. My other family members are like, this is like not a good look. Yeah. My son's getting scared. And all I'm thinking about is Dak Prescott. And it's crazy. You don't have money on the game. I don't I don't have a single parlay. You don't have a single money line. No fantasy. No fantasy team. That's pure fandom. I want my Cowboys to win. Yeah. And I am literally becoming a caveman. Yeah. At this TV. And I have, bro, I had to ask two things. Why do you think I am like that? And it's great. You said I'm the worst to watch sports. Yeah. And why are you not like that? You like I've watched you watch sports, especially players you care about. We'd like we would use to watch the brawn in the finals. We're always just kind of like this. Oh, do you go brawn? Dude, sick block. Yeah. I'm like hitting my fridge as he blocked Iguodala. I'm like breaking in my house. One therapy is necessary, right? One or help. One is like you. You have something in you that you don't know how to regulate. So you take it out on the on the Cowboys, right? Like that's because that's because of something else. That's not because of sports. That's that's like you got to see like it's like because you have to clean your plate as a kid. Oh, yeah, dude. Oh, yeah. I mean, that's it. That's a documentary in itself. Oh, my God, dude. But the second thing is after you stop playing competitive sports, you lost your purpose. Oh, that is low and stinging. Wow. After I stopped competing in collegiate division two sports, I lost my purpose of life. Holy hell in under 500. No. Yeah. But no. Well, no, we might have been above last year, above 500 last year. Close. It was not like a championship. No, we weren't one seed going to the tournament by any means. No, it was. No. Well, generally, I said that in a harsh way, but no. But yeah, I mean, I might. I think I'm going to I'm going to politely disagree with that. No, but but but but but it's true. I think I have purpose. Being a friend, a father, being a husband, being all those things. Those are big purposes in my life. I'm so I said that in a in a in a very stingy way. But the principle of it is true because like purpose and competitiveness, right? Because I went to go play pickup basketball with you and you were unrecognizable. It's on my Twitch YouTube channel. It gives unrecognizable like Tony Scream left my hit the gap. Get there. Yeah. Pain's like this. Oh, Chad. Wow. I'm out of shape, Chad. Oh, God. Oh, wow. God. Hey. Someone says five subs. I'll literally airball. He's like, oh, he's like, I'll point shape right now. I'll throw the game. And I'm like, set the spade. Like, yeah, dude. And there's like we're in a public gym where there's like eight like little league girl volleyball practice happening. I call it and they're scared. And Cam Cam is cussing out 30 year old men that just got off of their chase accounting job. You know what I mean? 100 percent. And and I'm not going to lie, I did. I spooked that one girl. Yeah. The ball rolled into the other court and they're fully playing volleyball. And I literally was like, like downhill head of steam. I was like, like coming after the ball. And the girl looks up and just sees that. And I'm probably beat red. Eyes are sunken in and black. And I'm like, yeah, yeah, you said, yeah, like, move, grab the ball, push the girl, go back up, check off. Like, yeah, it's yeah. And I think I really do think it's because I innately am very competitive person in like games and stuff like that. Like day to day life, like that is like, I don't know, like ego or whatever, something that I'm never competitive. People like I don't give a like. That's not true. That is not true. You are insufferable to play board games with to play board games. I'm talking about I don't care if I thought you said I thought you said outside of sports. No, I'm saying outside of game or stuff like that. I'm never the type like my car on your car. That's not true either. Oh, my God. That's not true. That's not true. That's not true. That's not true.

Chicago, Illinois. No on to the rest of the episode. Cayman Jack's. You should know podcast. Yeah, dude, speaking of sports, do you? Speaking of sports, do you remember the worst commercial of all time? Now, before you reveal it. OK, give me the era. Oh, year this was we were still probably watching like Drake and Josh around that Stanley Steamer. No, that makes your carpet cleaner. Dude, God, that was such a such a good jingle. Those little clay guys. You know, they look so good. Cam, you definitely know. You definitely know the worst commercial of all time. OK. OK. Try to dog walk sports. Oh, my God. Coach, I touch the ball. I touched it. It's out on me. Thank you, Daniel. Dude, I touch the ball before it went out. Coach is the worst commercial of all time. That is the now. Now let's be objective. If we are talking about the goal of what that is to make it, it's arguably one of the greatest because they made the goal of a commercial. Yes. For your product, whatever to be seen. I don't even think that's what they tried to do. No, no, they didn't. But they got lucky. You're right. So many people talked about how stupid and bad this was. That it was everywhere. So now you've got all these reviews. Now, the actual commercial itself is literally the biggest, biggest piece of bro. Oh, if you don't know, we're talking about basically I don't know what the commercial is for. And that's the crazy. It's like honesty commercial. It's like literally trying to tell you to be honest. I think that's what the commercial is about. There's not even a nonprofit. We're not selling you anything. Just be honest, I guess. Like, that's stupid. No, there has to be there has to be a company, a website, some. Somebody look that up. What was that? Well, we have no clue, but continue. We have no idea what they're trying to tell you. So look, if you don't know what the commercial is, basically, is this commercial where it's a championship game of a basketball game, a championship basketball game, right? It's a weird color hue over the commercial. It's like like copper. It's a bad luck. So they're playing this basketball game, championship game. The crowd's going wild. There's this play where two players go for the ball and it goes out of bounds. The ref calls out of bounds on the wrong team. The player goes the team that's happy that they got the call wrong. They run back in the huddle. There's one dude that just runs back to the huddle, like with his head down in the coach, the coach is like coaching. He's all right. We got this. He's like, we won the game. Now, the game is we're good. And this kid is in the back like this. Sitting there, his team's hype, he's literally behind everyone like this. Just sitting there. Yeah. And then what does he say? He goes, I guess I asked him like, what's wrong or something. Yeah, I remember he goes. I touch the ball. Everybody goes, what you just said? Yeah, he goes, I touched the ball before it went out. They go, what the you just say? He goes, I touch the ball for an hour, coach. Everybody's like looking like kind of like befuddled, right? This is the craziest. The the guy. No, the coach knows. No, listen, the coach, his teammates look at the coach goes, one of the kids name is Daniel. Yeah. It's always good to be honest. I appreciate your honesty. Then the player. Yeah. No, he goes. So the player goes to the ref, goes to the ref. He tells the ref like you see the him in the ref huddle. I was like, hey, by the way, I'm going to lose my team, the championship. Even the players like it's a championship game. Yeah, it's a championship game. He goes, I touch the ball for one hour. He runs to the ref, tells him the ref switched the calls, which will not happen. That can't happen. They run back to the he runs back to the huddle. The team wants to jump him. Yeah. And then the coach goes, hey, that's what he says. Yeah. Good call. Yeah. You imagine. Oh, my God. That is the oh, he's getting his. Be. Yes. OK. Imagine in a college basketball setting, we all play a college basketball. Oh, my God. No. That's like the year long grind it takes to get to a championship game. What would happen if one of your teammates would have done that? Payton, regardless, the teammate. Yeah. My coach, our coach in college, if I came into the huddle and said, coach, I touched the ball for one hour, he'd really go. And he would choke me by the throat. And probably go and spit my face, throw me to the end of the bitch, stop his heel and let it go. And he would be it would never get to my table. It would never, ever get to anyone. I let it go. Coach, I touched ball for now. He would choke me and let it go. What the did you say? He would literally have he would be beat red. And he would throw me behind the bitch. And I'm not exaggerating. Oh, my your scholarship's gone. Like you can't. Oh, my God. Yeah. I go back. My locker is literally bombed. Yeah. No, it's just it's excavated. My locker's out there. It's concrete. Any any sign of Payton Harden or Camp Kennedy is gone from this. Now, the teammates in college basketball, real basketball, not this commercial. Your teammates, I don't think I understand this. They would fit someone probably physically punch you in that huddle in front of the crowd. Yes. Someone would say, what the? Straight to the roof. Just gut your quickswear. You can't breathe. It's like you would never make it outside that huddle to go talk to a referee. Yeah. You can't. Your assistant coach goes Johnson. You're in. You're just like, oh, I touched the mother. Yeah, that would never have. Oh, my God. And the the fact that they think the guy can just solo trot to the ref. Excuse me, Mr. Referee. I touched the ball should be the other team's ball. And then the ref goes, oh, wow. Good job. Honesty, your honesty. New news. Oh, that's what it was. The end of the commercial said honesty. Pass it on. You. It can't say that. That's what it said. Oh, oh, my God. That is the that that is the worst commercial or arguably the best commercial of all time. That is in terms of getting they paid for one slot. That lives on the Internet like forever. I think this new generation hasn't seen it, so I can't wait for this to get like clipped and then they go see it, dude. Dude. Oh, my God. I'm going to talk to the writers room of that. Oh, man. See, it's no for but the. Honesty, let's just be honest, honestly, is not always the best thing. Oh, my God, you're about to get Kareem. Like, honestly, it's good, right? It's not always necessarily the right thing to do. Example, my father and me when I was younger. Yeah. My my wife literally a couple nights ago asked, Oh, my God, I can't wait for for Malachi to come home from school and put his little drawings on the fridge. And I choked on my fajita ball. I went, are you OK? I was like, yeah, just I never got to experience that. She goes, what? Oh, I said, yeah, I'd bring my art home. And my dad said it was so bad. He put it on the side of the fridge where no one could see it. It literally wasn't good enough to go on the front of the fridge. So that is an example. That is that is that is a that's a man. Like he said, this is my fridge, my home, I pay bills. That sucks. It's not getting displayed. Side of the fridge. No one can see. That's sad, but it's the truth. So are you going to display Malachi's? If he comes home with some, I don't know. But that brings me to the thing. Honesty. Yeah, that's brutal. Right. Very. I'm six. So traumatizing missing eight teeth. Yeah. I'm like, he could at least be like, oh, that's a beautiful tree. It looks great. Put it up there. He said sucks, kid. But now I don't draw anymore. So because of that, it's like it's I don't know. Honesty is good. Never enough to lose your entire team and city and school a champion. Yeah. Honesty is never sometimes honesty is overrated. Yeah. Like, well, I mean, yes. Oh, yes. Honestly, it's all about. Yeah. It's all honestly, honesty. Holy. Here we go. Oh, yeah. I just I just want to see if you remember that. That is that is. Oh, my God. That's the funniest. That is the worst commercial of all time. Holy. This episode is brought to you by Shopify. Shopify. Kim. Yes. We talk about it all the time. I know, brother.

We love how you all interact with our games. We're going to be doing the viral game that you can see all over TikTok. We're playing the viral game. Bring a random item to work game. Oh, oh, it's a backpack. This is a great bag. This is a Nike black on black military tactical bag. How long have you had that backpack? I had this bag for about two years. I've had this bag for about two years. It's a great bag. It gets me to and fro work. That's two only two years worth of. That it literally looks like you've had that since seventh grade. That bag is deflated and injured. This bag has has not been injured. This is not deflated and it's probably dusty because our working conditions. It looks like you did a tour in Iraq with that bag.

Oh, it's a replica. No, it's not. No, it's not. We're just going to we're going to end it right there. Why I didn't know we're showing the bags on camera. Oh, my God. It's you bring an item in your bag and then you reveal it. You think we're just going to spawn it in our hand. So basically, this game is bring a random item to work game. We had to bring three items. The only rule of this game is these are items that had to be in your house. Yes, you have to own them. You couldn't go out to the store and go buy them. So you're supposed to bring three random items from home. Me and Cam do not know what's in each other's bags. Yes. No clue. The person that is not pulling out items will have water in their mouth. Yes. During the pullout. Oh, oh, morning to you. Oh, my God. You have something in your mouth. You want to go first? I'll go first. Sure. I'll go first. You little freak. OK. Yeah. Oh, my Louis Vuitton. Honestly, honestly, Cam, your house is bare. I'm not I'm sure 99% of the things you're about to pull out are kids toys. OK. Hmm. Get that was a big gold dog. That was so much water in your mouth. How the you fit that much water? You literally kept going, bro. What the hell? I had a fat tongue. I didn't know you were a swig seawater bass. You just went like a pellic. Now get me through the week right there. All right. What that that is incriminating. I literally. All right. Water's going in. All right. Here we go. For my first item, ladies and gentlemen, I. I brought some little freak. What is that? Me and Liv had a lot of good nights with that is not going your wife. No, it can't. No, it does. Oh, dude. I was going to say, you know, we got to cut this game. This game's got to end. I was like, it's game has to end. Like, oh, this is a bottle cleaner. It's bottles you put in. Then you go. Yeah. See, I got a lot of that motion in my life. Sorry. Yeah. It's a bottle cleaner. Very well. What kind of baby bottles? Baby bottles. You was going to be baby. OK, OK. That's normal. That dad. Good father. Yeah. OK. OK, that was a good first item. First item. Yeah, we're warming up. You know, my turn. You see that my turn. Oh, God. This is from my house. This is from a hardened residence. Let me let me on to my leather Louie. I'll put more water in there, make it full. I don't have a freak mouth like you. My mouth was full just now. You really could get half of up. You should have got more water. All right, here we go. This guy's a hydrated king. You ready? All right. My first item from my house is big mouth, big mouth Billy Bass. Big mouth Billy Bass. You remember him? Vintage. How did I not think of that? I was literally trying to think, what is he going to bring? Yeah, that's on your mantle every day. Every day. It's his. Jamaican Bob Marley voice on up. He has two songs. Don't really like that one. So I just go with this. Big mouth Billy Bass is my first. OK, that's solid. Oh, my God. Sometimes I like to put my finger in his mouth. Oh, no. Yeah, you're a freak. You're a fion freak. It feels good when he's talking. OK. Oh, my God. I got water in. Oh, I can't show. I spit water in my bag. All right. Now this one right here. All right. This is deep. Let me put water in. This number two for me is deep lore. Deep lore. Mm hmm. Ready? Mm hmm. A one of five hundred limited edition memorial plate of Larry Bird comes with a certificate of authenticity. Swear to God, this is this literally one of five thousand. Rather, this is this was made in nineteen ninety one. But I don't know why it's memorial because Larry Bird is very much alive. Yeah. Well, why is it not that if somebody painted that, what do you mean? Authentication? There was only five thousand ever made. And this is this is this is plate number one, two, one, five. Very, very. I'm not going to lie. The idea of it's cool. The great white. Oh, somebody made that in their kitchen. They said one of five thousand and made and printed out certificate of. Larry Bird doesn't know that exists. Oh, yeah. No, Larry Bird does not make any money from this plate, but it is very unique. Didn't even know you like Larry Bird. Very cool. Yeah. Well, you got to have at least one white guy in the sport of basketball. The whole deer. For me, it's Larry and Dirk. Great White Hope is my second item. Do you eat off that? I've it's never been graced with a fork, spoon or knife. Will you for a special occasion? Never. I won't. Well, maybe maybe I could. I could eat off Larry's chin. Eat right off that little. Oh, my God. That mustache. I mean, that mother dude, he does not look like a Hooper dog. No, no, no, he does not look like a. That's your great white hope. This is my great white hope. This is who we used to pray to back in the day. And we wanted to jump higher. Honestly, at what point did you decide to get that? Oh, it was a gift passed down through generations. Wait, your dad had it. Olivia's grandpa. Pretty much one day I said, man, it's cool place. Take it. I said, all right. Where's the certificate of authenticity? Left that at the house that would count as my third and final item. So this was the only one right here. Yeah. OK. Larry Bird, Great White Hope Memorial. But the man still breathing plate. That's pretty cool. OK, pretty cool. That's nice. Oh, you were. Oh, dude, during show and tell. Oh, people just felt bad for your home. People are like, oh, he's less fortunate. OK, we said from our home. And this is this is some good. Where does it rest at in your house? On a on a on a shelf in my office right above my workspace. I don't know. It's like I have Larry looking over me, like protecting me with this weird shot. I did not know about the Larry lore in your house. He's well and alive. And think about it. That was made in 91 was like a hit out on Larry Bird or something. It's been 30 years since that play was made. And that's a memorial. If I Google that place, it's worth 12 cents. Probably probably zero, zero value. All right, here we go. You're number two. All right. My second item. Now, I forgot I had this item, but it means a lot to me. The second item is a commemorative East High. It's an East High. I don't know if it's a purse or not. I have a purse. It's not a purse. It's not a purse. Musical purse. It's not a purse. But it's just a purse. That's a purse. That's not a lunchbox. And there's a little secret Zac Efron charm on it. Peyton, you. Peyton. No, never used. Why the hell is that in pristine condition? That has net you have net you bought that and it is genuinely has been sitting and never used. Well, the fact no, no, no, I need you to unzip it. If it's not insulated on the inside, it's not a box. That's a purse. Oh, my God. You have a purse. Oh, my God. You have a Zachary. Oh, there's things in here. What? There's things. Yeah. Well, look, we got there's two little salt packets that come with the thing. I don't know if that's even fresh. You have used that as a lunchbox, a pair of chopsticks and two one hundred dollar chips from the El Cortez Las Vegas. I don't know what is tickling my brain more. The fact that you have a Zac Efron with a heart bedazzled bag charm on it. It's cute. First slash lunchbox. Or the fact that you have two hundred dollars in liquid cash that you've not cashed in in a Vegas casino. I don't even remember going to El Cortez. Oh, it's really cool. Oh, my God. I don't even know how to use chopsticks. So the fact that these are in here. Oh, my God. Pass me. Why the do you have that? Cool. No, no. There's the best movie trilogy of all time. That's not true. But there's a full blown bag charm on it. Yeah, it was like that is exactly 11 year old females buy that bag. And 26 and you're a 26 year old. I don't know when I bought this. I was probably like 23 or 24. Like it's decent quality. You see it's good leather. God, it's leather. Don't know how much it costs, but don't know where I got it from. I don't really remember. I think you've never you've never used this. I probably barely got two hundred dollars with that. Was this with you in Vegas? Has this been on your person or in your bag? I am with you in Vegas. Remember that time we were super drunk in Vegas when I was just like trying to buy to take home. I think I bought that. I was drunk. That's why all the weird don't really remember, though. You barely even like sushi. Why is there chopsticks? I don't know how to use chopsticks, Cam. This is OK for my this. This is not a lunchbox. Are you trying to take the money? No, this is a person. It's a lunchbox, bro. No, this is a purse. I'm taking the 200. You have to that. Yeah, no, honestly, don't break my purse. My lunchbox. I broke your purse. Give me my lunchbox. I don't even know who you are at this point. You can't say based on the two things I've brought so far. I have a fun home. You have the home of a I mean, genuinely, you have the home of like a like a crackhead. Like there's that's the you have a bass that sings you like reggae music and you have a memorabilia purse with a heart Zach Efron bag charm on it. Yeah, that has two hundred dollars to the El Cortez inside. What the actual OK, your last one. Oh, my God. All right. Oh, I don't even know what to do. I don't even know. I have a couple in here. Oh, God. OK. OK. Can you go a little quicker? I think I have a cavity. So the cold water is really hurting that back molar. Let's go a little quicker, please. I'm not joking. OK. For my last one. For my last one, I have a two for one special. One of them is something I know you guaranteed do not own. That is a collegiate diploma. I have my diploma to the institution of Arkansas Tech University. Second, what I know you've never touched held or used is a toot flute. This is a toot flute. This is not a used to flute, but it's a toot flute nonetheless. But this is this is instrumentation that has to be used on my son when he's too constipated. The flute goes into his rectum. Oh, Malachar. And out comes the poop or the gas. Now, OK, two for one. We were told to bring three items. So one of those things was recreationally in your bag. I believe it's the toot flute. Because I did not I did not bring this, but I saw in the bag when I opened it deep and wide. Toot flute was heavy on hand. We went through about 30 of these. Now, contrary to popular belief, you are not blowing into said flute. I don't really think I need to know how the toot flute works. You just lube up the end. You just Cameron. Sorry. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. But can I see your degree? And I've never held one. And guess what? The crazy part is the real thing's not in there. The real thing's not. This is this is this is literally not the real degree. It's an email printed out the real degree. I have in a safe. Why no one can get to it? No one wants it. Couple people do. Can they steal your ID if they get your degree? Couple people couple people died making that degree.

I guarantee I guarantee that's like a hit us and hardcore. God, he's got some weight to it. Dude, does a big turtle meant a lot to me. Peyton, what the you can I can. This is kind of creeping me out like I'm being honest. This is kind of no, no, no. Once you get over the initial spook of it all, it becomes very like it's like pure calcium. Yeah, dude, it means a lot to us. I can see is that cobwebs? You know, it's been here for a while. It's like seven. Peyton, this OK. No, it's about 20 year old children. No, but I'm not kidding. You have to think about what you're telling me. Yeah, this shell is intact. Right. Oh, yeah. Your father. No, he decimated that turtle. No, he didn't do that. Your father went to that turtle. Like Anakin did to the villagers. He said I killed them all. Well, no. OK, let's be honest. Children. He Jaws. His life was taken early. There wasn't much of the inside of that shell left. It was a it was a rough scene and we walked into it as children. So this is like skin, bro. There's like, oh, there's like skin on the inside. I can see his burp. No, no, no. Can I get please because you dropped them once. No, you dropped them. And so Jaws is now going to be a part of the wise case that. He used to walk around like this, too. Don't do, dude. Dude, I'm coming to get you lettuce. I'm coming to get your lettuce. And we call him Jaws because he would bite. Then he passed and your dad went, come here, buddy. You know what? You don't appreciate us. Don't put him in the purse. Don't put him in the purse. Going to lunch. That's a purse with $200. The old Cortez. What the you have like a a literal. That's like that's like if I brought my dead cat, Sammy. Why did why would you bring? No, no, no, that's literally if I went to my parents backyard and dug up the paper box that she's buried in and I said, look at my old cat. Yeah, if you brought the whipped out or skeleton, if you brought the box, that would be the same. I think you broke my purse. No, that is that is the equivalent. Jaws never like being confined. He's still fighting. He's like, let me out. Jaws and $200. The El Cortez has revived him. No, you broke the purse. Jaws really did not like his tank. So this is like a oh, my God, you're in PTSD. You broke the jaws, broke the purse. He said you did it and do it again. The purse you broke my purse. You have a dead turtle in a purse. What are we doing? Robbie, you have something to. Well, yeah, I knew we were doing this. And so I just thought like, oh, my God, do we water up? Oh, yeah, it's water. It's water up. OK, all right. First of all, it's the biggest bag. Why did you bring up? No, you brought a gym bag. You have dumbbells. You have 20 pound dumbbells in there. No, definitely not. However, I think you'll be surprised with what I brought. The first item I bought this not because I care about it, but in hopes that it would be valuable one day. OK, nothing crazy, but it's a Mr. Beast lunchbox. You know, and so I figured, you know, who knows one day maybe he's, he's, you know, who knows what that's going to be worth one day. You bought a feastables lunchbox feastables lunchbox. That means you bought that in the last two years. Mr. Beast. Correct. It's mass produced in Walmart. Yeah, but the point is, that's not going to be valuable. The point is, is one day it might be. OK. All his charitable work. You never know. All right, item one. It's actually a really cool box. I know. Payton's like, I want it. Item two. This was just an absolute impulse buy. Thought it would be a great idea. Oh, you have your own. That's how I met his son in those. I got killed on the Internet. Those are comfortable. They're not bad. They're not bad. Not bad at all. You bought your own. We could be twin toes. Last item. It's my prized possession. Thought I'd bring it along today. It's my belt. It's my belt. You went to my house. That's your lunchbox and slides. The champ does what he wants. If anybody's wondering why Robbie's facing 90 days in prison. I got your calls too. Can't see me. You literally, he just robbed my house. He went to your house and robbed you. I literally saw him today driving towards my house on the way to the studio. And I was like, why the Robbie heading this direction? What the Robbie? I just moved in. I didn't have anything. So I said, I'll go scouting. Hey, water up one last time. Water up one last time. Water up one last time. Water up one last time. I had one more item. This kind of just goes to my childhood. But I bought this recently as a full man that pays taxes to the federal government. It's a Yu-Gi-Oh! Structure Deck. The saga of the Blue Eyes White Dragon. It's playable, tournament ready, and it's very solid. The spell and trap power is unmatched for a structure deck. Just brought this to showcase it. It also comes with a play mat. $16.99. Has the Blue Eyes White Dragon and the Azure Dragon. With no intention of playing. Have you ever played this? All the time. With who? On tour, I bought another deck. I brought the structure deck to the entering the dark world for me and CJ to try to teach him Yu-Gi-Oh! He couldn't comprehend it. Put him back in my bag. There's two things I've learned about this game. One, Cam's house, he needs more fun in it. Cam literally has no fun in his home. He brought a plate, a cleaner, and a flute. And his degree. We need Cam to get outside the house. We need to help him. Second thing is, Robbie's a f***ing felon. And he has stolen my most prized possessions. First of all, thank you for reminding me I had that Feastables lunchbox. It looked f***ing familiar and I was like, why? When you whipped it out, I said, I'm pretty sure he has that. And then he pulled out the slide. I said, that f***ing thing is way too big for his little hog. You took my f***ing, my new spinner belt that literally hasn't touched environment yet. Literally hasn't been outside of environment. It's been in my home. It's on a sweaty carousel. It's been on the sweatiest guy I know. But you're not off the f***ing chain either. In a $12 f***ing duffel bag. No, you're not off the chain. Okay, prick. You're not off the chain either. You are a freak. I need to have fun. You brought a f***ing reggae singing bass. East high purse made of leather. And then you had a dead turtle in a Louis Vuitton. I might need to have more fun. You might need to be literally background checked. You had a dead turtle in a Louis duffel. It's a, it's a, it's like, it's the same thing as getting your grandpa asht. No, the f***, it's not. That's like keeping your grandpa's femur bone. Getting him asht is one thing. It's like, ah, this is my grandpa's mandible. It's his jaw. I keep it with him. I pop him on the table when I want to eat a quick sandwich. You have the literal shell of a decimated turtle. Are we, we're not skipping over that. Inside a Louis. Yeah, I have a two-foot ghost, my son's a f***ing d***. Freaky little cleaner that can also be doubled as some fun night pleasures. But you have a dead turtle in a expensive leather, not of this country back. People would think I live on the set of iCarly. Yeah, you are not, you are not Norman. You're just a thief. That was a fun game. I watched that game. That was really fun.

All right, anyway, so step into my mind, step into my life. Your hip now hurts. Your head is now weighs more. Here we go. Loud. Kid, loud. But here we go. We went to eat at Blue Goose. This is Friday night. I don't know what Blue Goose is. Mexican restaurant. Just say Mexican restaurant. Blue Goose Cantina. Just say Mexican restaurant. OK, we went to eat at a Mexican restaurant. Nice. What the? What was that? Why can I not say that? I don't know what Blue Goose is. OK. I know what a Mexican restaurant is. We went to eat at a Mexican cantina. It was. God. What the? Cantina? Jar Jar Binks? Are you Jabba the Hutt's in there? So you have the gall to refer to Jar Jar Binks. I meant to say Jabba the Hutt. When I say cantina. Jabba the Hutt was in the cantina. I went in with a little squid on the trombone. You kind of look like Jabba the Hutt. No, I don't. No, I don't at all. At all, don't you dare. I used to want to squish him. Oh, no. I was always afraid he smelled horrid. Yeah, I want to play with his little tail. You want to play with something else too. Close to that tail, didn't you? What is his genitalia? What? What is Jabba the Hutt's genitalia? Like, no, seriously. What are Jabba the Hutt's genitalia? Yeah, what are his pronouns? Whatever he wants them to be. They want them to be. Whatever they want them to be. It's clearly the Hutt. Because his name is Jabba and he goes by the Hutt. Jabba the Hutt. Power to you, big dog. You're a hutt. Cameron the Hutt. So we went out and ate Mexican food at a Mexican restaurant. We got through that one. We did. That was close. That was about, I mean, that was Amelia Earhart. Robbie's about to walk out. That was Amelia Earhart. Woo. God, thank God Pierce isn't here. Oh, yeah. How are you? He didn't deserve that name. Here we go. So we were eating Mexican food. It was a good dinner Friday night. It was me and Liv's mom and stepdad and Liv and Malachi. That's a loud table. Loud table. A bunch of peacocks. So it ends. What ends? The dinner. The dinner ends. Are you going to criticize me? You know exactly what ends. You're trying to tell stories like- What do you think is the game of bingo we're playing? Meal ends. The night ends at the restaurant. The comments are going to get on me for correcting you all the time. Yeah, they are. But you can tell stories like your wife now. No, I don't. You've lost the art of storytelling. No, I don't. We've gone to the thing and so we were at the thing is ending and then so we're all there at the thing, right? That's literally not what I said. Oh my God. That's what he said. And when the f*** did you become the ABC police? When did you become the ABC police? Tell me what jurisdiction they roam over. The ABC police. Do I have to explain that one too? Because that's not a real thing. Now we don't get jokes. They go right over your head. That's a joke. Right over that little divot. That's called the dip. A dip. The kitchen. The f***ing Konax. Cornhole. What is it called? Cornpwn. Shut up. Here we go. From the top. Friday night. Me and my family were eating at a Mexican restaurant. The meal ended. Nice. As we were leaving the restaurant, everyone hugged. Goodbye, goodbye. Drive safe. I tuck my son into his car seat. Say goodbye to the wife. Smack the rear. Y'all drove separately? Drove separately because from different locations. Weird. Not really. Oh, oh wow. This is going to be challenging. Here we go. Here we go. I can't do it. My legs are too sore. No, I need it. Okay, here we go. I tell my wife. Your legs? Have you ever seen like a shaved ostrich? No, it's good. Hey, it's over, bro. It's over. It's over, bro. Your leg looks like a chicken breast that's been left out too long. That's fine. Take a nibble. It's done. Go ahead. Sorry. No, it's done. Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Because comments. No, you're good. You're good. Sorry to the comments. It's good. Let's talk about your crotch. Pinch, pinch and roll. Pinch, roll, tilt it to the left. Bit itchy, bit sore. No, mine's like straight up and dead. It's like. I'm a f***ing konax. Come on. When it shrinks, but the skin obviously has to go somewhere and starts rolling to the side. You remember those caps that you could go to those like little colored ones? That's what it looks like right now. No, I'm not gonna lie. This is the craziest thing I've ever said. I'm feeling very frisky right now. So I'm gonna say. I'm circumcised. Me too. But that's not what I'm saying. When I was young and I know we all tried to catch the water, right? No, we all said. I've never been involved in that committee. That might be a white culture. That might be a white culture thing. I'd be in a shower and I was like, you gotta let me get to the store. It's not coming out. When I was young, very new to showers, I would grab the skin on my penis. I'd grab the skin and I would try to catch the water. But then one day I grabbed both ends and I raised it perfectly. They both went out like that and I thought it was a man lifting his arms. So I acted like he was singing and going like this. With my own Johnson. You're lucky I can't fire you. So mean. Man, we're leaving the restaurant. I tell my wife, hey, I think I got to poop because I just tried to push a fart out and I'm feeling a lot of liquid. That's so irresponsible. I go back to the restaurant. She takes off, drive safe. You want I go back to the restaurant, two stalls. One guy is already in the corner stall. I go, gotta go in this one. I sit next to him and it was one of those farts where it was just straight air and gas built up. It feels good, right? It feels great coming out. Yeah. But it is so, so loud. Oh, no. And I cannot control how much audible farts are coming out of me. Good acoustics in the bathroom. I sit down. This guy's quiet mind his own business taking a and I literally sit down and it goes. And I go, I go, oh, I'm sitting there because I cannot control it. And it's to the point I'm now I'm sucking releasing sucking releasing. I'm sucking to try to hold, let the air fill out. Yeah, dude. Do you ever get like a little as soon as I let go, it goes. And I go, I literally go, oh, because it's so loud and I can't, I want to be silent. No one wants to be the lounge besides K-Rob, but I don't want to be loud. I just want to get this out of me. So I'm trying, literally trying to pace myself now. And I go, I go. I retract again, tighten up the guys just sitting there, no complaints yet. And I go, God dang, there's so much left. I go round three. And it goes. And then it's just talking. He's talking. And I go, it's to the point I I'm now teary eyed laughing. And how loud my own is in a public restroom with another man that did not ask for this. And then so then we're hitting round four. We're midway through the fight. So I literally go, this got to be the knockout round. I'm not going to win on the scorecards. I got to beat him right here. I got to beat him right here. I don't I don't walk out with the victory. And I literally I buckle down. I grabbed that little bar and I go, I go, I'm going for yard. I'm swinging for the fences. The counts three, two, I got to get the home run. And instead of just letting go, I let go with a push. And I went and it went. And it was sounded like a syntax went off in in like a soup kitchen. And it was the loud. Now I'm saying this now, that's very descriptive. And I do apologize if you're eating food, but I'm saying this now you apologize. Because at that point, after I go for the knockout, it is incredibly loud. And the guy next to me literally goes, man, what the. And he just says it to himself. And I am I'm literally crying. I'm crying in the store. And now I'm playing the game of I cannot let him see my face. So I go, it's all out. And I'm literally sitting there. I'm wiping quick. I throw it all away. I get up sprint, wash my hands so fast. And as I'm drying, because they didn't have any paper towels. So as I'm drying, I'm like, God, this is a hindrance. I'm like, this is just making me go slower. I hear his flush and I go, oh, no, I'm drying quick. I book it now for my own sanity. I leave the restaurant. There's immediately an exit door right by the bathrooms. I leave and I go, God, I want to see what he looks like. I want to see the face of that victim. So I wait outside the restaurant. I fake a phone call. Oh, yeah, I'm about to turn on. Yeah, I'm about to head home. Whatever. I'm talking to myself. I turn around. I look at him. He was the guy. He's probably late 30s, early 40s. Dad's got a ball cap on. He comes out of the bathroom. That scanning the restaurant. He looked like this. He's just looking and I go, oh, God, I ruined his day talking to no one. And I drive home. It was on. It was so, so loud. And I'm not kidding. The length of the loudness was what was just unbelievable. You might be the bathroom Ted Bundy. I might be. Honestly, I might be. So do that first of all. And then it's uncontrollable. That's the part that made it funny. I could not do it. So Ted Bundy said the same thing. I could control it. Something made me. And then for you to wait outside your day, you have a kid at home. You have a kid and a wife. You have responsibilities to go take care of. I need to get behind them. Yeah. And you're like, I want to see his face. That's a problem. I'll level with you on that one. That's a little creepy. That's a bit weird. I got some bathroom stories and some poop stories, but I think we'll save that for Patreon. Remember, oh my God, the Patreon Koala Prime is 25% off.

And it was before we filmed the Koala Royalty that came out. And I went in there to go pee and there was a dude in the first stall. And he was literally like, like sitting there, I assume. I saw his feet. I saw his arm. Yeah, I saw his feet. He was painting. Yeah. And he, it was like you, but there was solid coming out of it, right? You could hear that bouncing off the bag board, right? Oh God. But he was like, I swear to God, moaning on my mother's life. No. Oh no. He's crying? No, no. I have never, I've never sh** to the point of tears, ever. There's been some hurtful ones. I've felt, I've felt vigor. Oh my God, one, two. No, that is close. Oh, he just called me a d***. No, I did not. I said there's been some hurtful ones that I've been angry enough to feel vigor, but that's close, but it's not the cigar. Divo Ladi got mo head then he got body.
