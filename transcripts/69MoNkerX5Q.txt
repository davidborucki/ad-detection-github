White House shit? The White House card? Yeah, I want to talk about the... You see McGregor officially confirmed that he's on the White House card? I did. He announced it on Fox News. Yeah, he went on our boy Sean Hannity. I don't know if that actually happened or he's just saying that. You never know with Connor, right? I think he's going to be on the card. I think he's going to be on it, but I don't think it's... He's smart because it could have not been locked in and then when he says it on Fox News and gets the fans behind him. Well, Bill's on Pike Bright too. Well, that's what I think he's doing. I think that he's... It's probably in the final, final stages. Yeah. And they're probably maybe bickering over final, final points. But McGregor is just getting ahead of it and he's kind of pressuring them. And now he's setting the expectation to like the fan base in the entire world. That it's like, yo, I'm on the card. What do you think is going to be on that card? Like this is like... This is a once, one time thing. Yeah. You guys saw the renderings of the thing too? That Dana put on Fox News. No, what was it? Like the way it's going to look. Oh, yeah. It looks insane. Yeah. I mean, this shit's a year out, isn't it? It is, yeah. Before we get into that too, I think like... How do you get invited? That's what I was going to talk about. Here we go. You want to just let us know? No, I think like... No, usually all tickets like they kind of like funnel through Gabe and stuff like that. But yeah, if somehow he's there and I'm not there, I'll never talk to you again. This one I'm not bringing a plus one. Yeah. So I think everyone's on their own. You got to text Dana yourself for this one. Trust me, I texted his son this morning, checked in on him. Oh, Dana White Jr? Yeah, after I sold him a Gregor announcement. Because usually it's 25,000 people. This is only 5,000 people. So yeah, I think this is kind of like... You guys got to... I'm cool with that. I think it'll be good. Yeah, you got to start asking. 5,000 people is more than I thought, honestly. But I think it's going to be like... That's the same as the Sphere. No, Sphere was way more than 5,000, no? I think it's the Sphere. But this one's going to be like world leaders and like... And then CEO of Nelk. I don't... Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what's... I mean, isn't there going to be another stage too for fans? Yeah, there's going to be a watch area. There's going to be so many people. Oh, like just... Just that... That's going to be a shit show though. Yeah, no, if Gabe... Well, I'm going to say it again. If Gabe somehow goes and I don't go, I'll never talk to you again. Well, the tick is fine. Yeah. And I actually am going to make sure that Gabe doesn't go. I don't know why I'm fired up about it right now, but I'm going to make sure. Well, it's kind of Dana's choice, right? Me too, bro. We talk all the time on DM. You know, since like Dana's saying like he doesn't trust John Jones, I mean, who else do you see, you know, being that main event? You think Conor? Conor McGregor as the main event versus someone. Jones versus Aspenall. But Dana said how he feels about Jones. I think they're kind of just posturing with Jones as well for that too. I think that they want Jones on that card. And then three is Toporia versus Islam. If that somehow shapes up by next July too, because you got to see how everything plays out. But in my opinion, comment what you guys think too. But I think those are the only possible big enough three main events. So the shit talking. My God. I think it'll be McGregor for sure as the main event. Where's the press are going to be? Did they say that? I think it's at the Washington Monument. There's some shit. You know, people are shading them being like, this is unprofessional to have a fight at the White House. And I'm like, dude, this is the most American thing of all time. Yeah, I think it's crazy, bro. Well, right when I saw the renderings, I was like, dude, this is really going to put the UFC on another level, bro. Especially if it's just live on CBS, not behind a paywall. That's how they're doing this one. I think it's still up in the air, but it might be. It might just really live and free. You might have to. That'd be crazy backlash if they don't do that free, I feel like. But I was thinking, imagine, guys, I guess because they just announced now Armand. He's fighting in November. Where he's fighting in Qatar against UFC. Dan Hooker fight night. Did he just do some fucking random wrestling match or something? Well, yeah, he does BJJ. But he just signed. He just signed a fight. He just people were excited. How many I mean, I watched you. People are expecting him to maybe fight for the title next, but he got Dan Hooker. So that also leaves Gagey Justin Gagey and Patty Pimlet as possible fighting. Ilya or no, that's what we're wondering. I think they're going to hold off Ilya until 2026. I think we're going to have to see Patty or just I think it's going to be at Armand and Hooker just got announced. I think they're going to do Patty Pimlet versus Justin Gagey. And then I think they're going to wait and see what happens with Islam and JDM. If Islam wins, Ilya wins. But I don't know if Ilya will fight before July. I think they're going to wait. We'll wait and see what happens with Islam. If Islam wins, then it potentially could be that's a super fight, potentially could be Ilya versus Islam. I mean, Gagey did say he's going to retire if he doesn't get the shot next. So we're going to see what happens. But it's looking like Pimlet and Gagey. And from there, I think they give to Poria somebody in January. I mean, depending on if Armand wins. Fuck, dude, it's so tricky. Focusing on the biggest thing, like if you're an American, you're fighting at the White House. You better fucking win that fight. Yeah, of course. But that's what I'm wondering. I wonder if they're going to go like all American fighters or they just going to make like a sick ass card. You got to have an American fight at every fucking fight, I think. Yeah, you're fighting at the White House. I think they got to make it as sick as possible. It's crazy. It just doesn't make any sense. The biggest combat sports event of all time. 100 percent. For sure. This is insane. I don't think worldwide. Like, imagine the clips and like the White House is in the background. Oh, my God. They're walking out of the Oval Office. Yeah. Is that confirmed? Trump's probably going to be having like dog talk with them in the Oval Office before and shit. Imagine McGregor and Trump with a spew. Yeah. Holy fuck. Those guys can go for sure. Damn, I'm going to have to start texting Dana and just randomly sending him shit. 100 percent, bro. What would you do if my seat was in front of yours? You'd cry. You'd leave. That would never happen. You'd walk out of the White House. That would never happen. Oh, yeah. I don't know if they'll have. Imagine they put Ilia, Islam and McGregor on the same card. Imagine that press conference. I keep forgetting about McGregor and Islam on the same panel. McGregor and Islam. Yeah, that'd be fucking nuts. That would be fucking insane because then you get the Khabib factor involved. We need to see that shit again. Honestly, we need that back. How much would you personally pitch? And guys, comment this as well, too. How much would you personally pitch to watch Khabib and McGregor, too? We need to start like a fucking... We need to start like a worldwide GoFundMe for that. But Khabib won't crack. We know he retired first. To see Khabib, McGregor, too, now? Yeah. To be at the fight. To be at the fight. How much would you pay? I would pay a lot. I would want to see that. Yeah. I don't know how it would be now. Isn't McGregor like 38 now? Well, they've both been out of it for a while. It's almost too far too gone. Yeah, I know. But I'm just like... Just what they... Seeing each other again after that whole thing. You know what I learned though? It was such a fucking great time, the first go around. You'll never remake that again. Like, have you watched when McGregor starts talking to Ali and like bringing up names of people that aren't even there? You realize how deep that shit is? And I was like, yo, this is fucking crazy. That first press conference where there was like, it was just them two. That was fucking dark. Like, that was insane. Like, I watch that back sometimes, bro. Like, it's just like, holy fuck. McGregor press conference highlights all the time. But that was specifically like... I think Conor, like, they hated each other like crazy. Like, Conor before, yeah, he talked shit. A guy named Steven, what was the guy's name he fought? Who the fuck is that? Jeremy Stevens, yeah. Jeremy Stevens, he's fighting Mike Perry in Bare Knuckle right now. I saw that guy, I was like, holy shit. And Conor wants to get into Bare Knuckle too. He mentioned that as well. We'll see about that. I mean... Islam and McGregor in Bare Knuckle, how crazy would that be? Fuck. That would do a lot of pay-for-view. That wouldn't happen. But I guess McGregor has two fights left on his contract. So it'll be interesting to see. I know everyone's counting McGregor out. He's obviously old. He's not the same, obviously. But if he comes and puts on a show, if he wins... I mean, if he's fighting Chandler too, he probably has a good chance of winning. One big win, like a flashy win too, things change. He has one fight left on his UFC contract. You never know who he could fight, right? It'd be interesting. And you know he wants to fight out that contract because then after that, he can do all these easy-ass boxing matches, just make like fucking 20, $30 million bags. That front row of White House seating is gonna be Trump, Dana, Kid Rock, Taylor LeWan. No. We'll do it all somehow, be up there like... And Papino? Yeah, we'll do it in Papino. Dude, honestly, I will say Steve's IG content right now is my favorite Steve content that I've seen in like the last however many years. Yeah, I filmed a video with him yesterday. Really? With Papino. Like for what? He has a new series, The Convict Kitchen. So he asked me to do an episode with him as a guest judge and Papino's like the cop and he just walks around and kind of like patrols. And like the three convicts, it was like pretty serious charges, bro. One guy had terrorist charges, one guy had... Terrorist? Five charges for attempted murder. How the fuck did he find a terrorist? Drug trafficking. I don't know, it was fucking crazy. I was like, dude, these are like real ass. There's no way he had a terrorist charge. Like domestic media? He looked exactly like Johnny Sins. Like it was the... So he's like an Antifa fucker or something? Yeah, something like that. It didn't make any sense. And he was honestly a great guy, which also threw you off. And he had the best meal by far. It was the weirdest fucking thing ever. I don't wanna spoil too much, but you had to like cook the meal with a piece of contraband in it. Like it's pretty funny. That's hilarious. Steve was back in his normal self. Steve just seems, he seems happy. Yeah, I think he is. You could kind of like see it through his stories too. Personalize. How is Pepino? He's the most interesting dude ever. I really wanna, I'm gonna meet him I think tomorrow. Yeah, you will. I mean, it's the most degenerate squad you've ever seen, but it's pure entertainment. He's a funny guy. So do you guys like get along? I could see you guys not. No, we get along. Yeah? He doesn't like... I mean, dude, Steve lives five minutes from me now. Oh shit. So I'll just drive down there and see what's going on. There's always something going on there. Pepino is an interesting guy. I find him hilarious though. No, he's funny. I was telling you, I just think he's so funny. Yeah, he is. He's funny. Bro, that LeBron stream. Oh my God, we should talk about that. I'm gonna be honest, bro. I watched, we interviewed fucking Kai right here. Yeah. Probably like three years ago. And that guy's at a different level and dude, I don't know why people hate on that guy. He is on a different fucking level. No, bro, good on him. A million subs. I mean, he's the first ever to have a million subs on Twitch, right? That's not even right. People just, they call it the beg-a-thon. He's begging for, I'm like, dude, that production probably costs seven figures. Bro, he had Alicia Keys, Kevin Hart, LeBron. That's what I'm saying, is people forget. Dude, that was a lit stream. Linkin Park performing out of nowhere, then the next day. Linkin Park is probably the craziest one out of all of them. They haven't performed and they had a new, because the singer passed away. So they had a new woman singer and they just showed up. It's no big deal. The bar set so high for that fucker. Out of those three, Speed, Kai and Aiden, who do you think's the biggest? I mean, Speed, yeah, worldwide. Dude, you can't have LeBron over casually. It's fuck, I mean, Speed was the Tom Brady. Yeah, I mean, LeBron's huge, fuck. Tom Brady's huge, too. I've never seen that guy do anything like that. Speed got 40 mil on IG, bro. I think the biggest is Speed, probably worldwide. Like, hearing-wise, too. Like, you hear Kai more than Speed. Yeah. Do you hear Aiden more than Speed? Like, that's what I mean, too. I hear Kai the most, I feel like. I think Kai's the not- I hear Kai the most, too. Kai's the not the biggest in America, for sure. Yeah. Speed is the biggest. Did you ever watch any of it? Like, when he goes to other countries and stuff like that, like when he went to Asia. I have YouTube on my TV, so sometimes when I'm just like, what, I open YouTube on my TV, I'll see Speed live and I'll click it. It's like 130,000 people live. Yeah, Speed's hilarious, but. And he's just like fucking- He did 35 days, too, like on the road, like across the country, bro. Those guys, fuck, man. Streaming's different. It's interesting how Speed and Kai did it 30 days at the same time, right? Was that like a little bit of competition? Who knows? All these people stir, I only see the internet, but they stir the pot behind the scenes, acting like there's a beef between the three, but I don't know what it is. I don't think there's a beef. I think they just wanna focus on themselves. No, they're friends. Yeah, I don't think it's a beef. I think there's always friendly competition with anything, right? Like, look how it is just with anyone, right? There's always friendly competition, but it is interesting how Speed and Kai did it at the same time, 30 days, right? Yeah, well, they probably just took up the entire, Speed's on YouTube, I guess. Right. They just dominated. No other streamers were probably streaming that much those 30 days. Yeah, I think Kai's was a bit bigger, probably. I mean, dude, you have the biggest names in the world like that every night. It's fucking insane. Has LeBron ever done a stream, too? I don't think so, yeah, he's never done a stream. That's huge. But when I seen him announce that Kai, I was like, what the fuck, bro? Like, he's just killing it, man. Oh yeah, and then the Kevin Hart shit, too, is like, watch some of like, Kevin Hart's, like funniest shit. He's fucking funny, bro. Like, I know he's probably doing movies still and stuff like that, but I don't know what movies I've seen. They're doing a movie, those three. Yeah, but what Kevin Hart movie have you seen in the last like, few years? That's like. Get Hard, is that Kevin Hart? I don't know. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like, I think, I don't know, the shit he's doing with Kai recently, and Druski is like, some of the funniest shit that I've seen. They're good together, those three. Yeah. They're fucking hilarious together. You see when he called Ruby Rose, and he fell in the background? I don't know, just all three of them together, they just, they make for great content. They make great content. Kevin's not afraid to like, get after it, too. Like, he asked Ruby Rose if Druski fucks with his shirt on. Yeah. Oh, he did? That's crazy. I saw Kevin's ask if she ate his ass or some shit. Oh, that too, yeah. I didn't see the shirt for it. That's crazy. I mean, whatever. That's absurd, bro. She's talking about this, I actually, I really. What, Bob Mennery in the hospital? Yeah, what the hell happened? I don't know, have you talked to him? I think he's just chilling. No, he got full on like. He's treating it like a hotel. Oh, he is? Yeah. Wow, he would FaceTime me and be like, yo, the nurse is pretty hot, and then he'd have like a thing on his finger and like look like he's having the time of his life. So what happened to him, does anyone know? Maybe he couldn't afford hotels for a few days, too, right? No way, you think he has health insurance? Does Bob have health insurance? There's no fucking chance. He's definitely zealing them like, yo, let me, what's your zeal? He's fucking playing roulette, laying in that bed. There's people that actually need that hospital bed and he's taking it up. No, he looked sick though. Oh, really? In the first story he posted, he looked really sick. I thought he was just sick of hotels, he's like, I gotta try something different. I wonder if it's like catching, maybe it's just catching up to him. I texted him, he said he had a zap lodged in his stomach. That's what he said. That's what he's there for? Yeah, but no, he posted a photo of like his stomach like sewed up. I think he actually got like some type of surgery. Damn, I'm gonna check him for that. Bob is like, I don't know how the hell he functions. He's a fucking robot. Yeah, he's not a real human. Did you watch the Charlie Sheen documentary? No. It's fucking. I saw he claims he slept with 47,000 women. Really? Yeah, which is not possible, but. Well, I think what I didn't realize about Charlie Sheen 2 is he also went gay too. Yeah. That's why I wanna get out of LA. I feel like that actually happens people, maybe if you stay here long enough. I'm serious, buddy. You're worried about that. I'm not, I mean. It's just part of our own self. No, dude, but you don't get it. He hates himself. I don't think LA. It's not cause they're gay, it's because they've partied for too long. No, it's not cause they're gay, it's cause they've partied for so long. I don't think LA is gonna change that for you, but yeah, you're like. That's just not gonna go. If I live in Nashville, I'm not going down that road. Mexico, like. Just anywhere you're lonely. Any geography, it doesn't matter. It's gonna go down. For you, yeah. Nah, I'm going to Nashville or somewhere. Alabama. That shit doesn't fly. But I guess it's true. I guess he just fucks so many chicks that you just get bored and you're just like, you know, I wanna try cock now. Yeah, Diplo did it too. Oh my goodness. I'm not justifying him, just saying. What I realized about Sheen 2 and like it's cool cause they had like Sean Penn in it and stuff like that. And they're just saying like, it's kind of like a Steve will do it thing. Like how Steve could drink so much. Like Sheen could just do so much fucking blow. Yeah, I know. Like everyone's like, yo, we don't know how you're like. A lot of those guys wouldn't be, dude. You'd like, he would not be as bad now because you can't get away with that shit like you could back then. Right. There's no one's monitoring you and shit. And if he was out like that, they would have put it to a stop way quicker. Did you know Nicolas Cage was a degen? Yeah. I didn't know that. Bro. Weren't him and Sheen like boys? Yeah. Yeah. Nick Cage, he's a legend. I didn't know Nick Cage was a degen. I kind of thought he was a loser. Oh dude. He fucking party, right? Yeah. All right guys, crypto is going absolutely crazy right now.

We're filming two Nelk videos, Japan and China. So it's gonna be crazy. I just posted it on my story. I'm getting a lot of replies on it. I think people are like really excited for it. You scared of China? No, I want to go to China. I don't know what the hell to expect from China. As soon as you get in, you're tapped in. They got you, like. I love China. Forever and you want me to watch it. No, I'm just like, that doesn't like, kind of like, I don't know. Yeah. Bother you a bit? No, no, I think China's. Shanghai, Beijing, I've always wanted to go there. Honestly, since rush hour, I've always wanted to go there. We've been going to China for like 10 days. Yeah, I know. We're seeing like the whole country. We're not just going to Hong Kong. I think we're going to like the outskirts. Macau. I think so. Macau's legendary. That's a casino town. Biggest gamblers ever. Like huge, huge gambling. See, that's a country where I'm just like, I feel like we haven't done a crazy international one like that in a minute, right? I mean, we did Tribe. Yeah. That was pretty cool. But. Who's the guest appearances on this one? Jesse's coming, MTV Pat. I know. Nino's coming to Japan. We couldn't get their visas done for China. Steve wanted to come to China too, but we couldn't get his visa. But yeah, that'll be cool. But China is just like a country. Anything epic planned? For China? Yeah. You're going to fucking live stream you running the Great Wall? I'm down to run on the Great Wall. How many miles is the Great Wall? 13,000. No fucking way. Yeah. That's your next stream. I don't think you should get to leave until you run the whole wall, bro. 13,000? Yeah, run on the wall. Can you do it or no? I don't think so. 13,000 miles. I didn't know the Great Wall of China was that long. You said it. I know, I'm saying. Is that confirmed? I searched it up. Holy shit. Well, I thought, I'll be honest, I thought about that. I was like, oh, I wonder. But then I was like, oh, what the fuck? Can you do anything on there? That's what we got to think of something. I'm definitely down to rip some miles on the Great Wall though. Yeah. It's legendary. I wonder what you can and can't do there. I just don't know what to expect from China, to be honest. The technology there is what I think is insane. And I think Americans maybe have, it's like any country we go to. I remember the first time we went to Abu Dhabi. Now it's more acceptable, but the first time we got invited to Abu Dhabi during COVID, everybody was telling us not to go. It's so crazy to think about. I remember people in our circle, parents were calling, you guys can't go to Abu Dhabi, you can't drink there, you guys are gonna get arrested, blah, blah, blah, blah, but I find every country that we end up going to, it's always the complete opposite of what the American perception of a country is too. And I feel like China is definitely gonna be one of those countries. It's gonna be fascinating to see. I don't know anyone personal who's ever been there. Not one person I've ever, or I'm friends with has been to China, so that's why I wanna go. You really can't believe anything until you just go for yourself too, right? I mean, yeah, every place has been, like you said, what, Russia too. I mean, we were with Islam, but. Yeah, Russia's scary though. That was scary, yeah. I mean, we were with Islam, yeah. You gotta go to some countries with the right people, I think. Abu Dhabi definitely, yeah, was one. And then again, we were with Dana White. Exactly, yeah. It's tough. China, just the technology, right? Did you see that thing Gabe put in the group where they put it on the, there's like something you put on your legs and it like runs for you? No. It's fucking crazy. Why? Well, no shit, he's looking that up. Yeah, he put it in the group. Yeah, I mean, it makes sense, so he doesn't have to move, right? It just runs for you, still burn calories. Huh? It still burn calories? I mean, probably not as much. Wait, put a little motor on his back. No, it's like, it like attaches to your legs and then the guy like slowly amps it up. And he just runs for you. And then eventually he's like running and he's like freaking out because he's like, dude, I'm not even moving my legs. What the fuck? And then he asks the Chinese guy in the shot. I don't believe, I don't agree with that kind of technology. Why? It's another reason for humans to be lazy. I don't fuck with that. I wanna try that. You gotta fucking buy legs that run for you to lose weight. That could be our rip to run the whole Great Wall. Yeah, I mean, I would do it then. Use the legs. How fast, you know what speed you can get up to? I don't know. Wow, that's crazy. However you can make people lazier, this is the next wave. What's one thing you wanna do in China? I don't know, I haven't thought about it that deep. Cause you never get too fired up for international shit. But China, you're like genuinely excited for it. Yes, yes, I always get fired up. No, no, but like you could tell you have a genuine interest. You've said you've always wanted to go to China, is what I meant. Just cause I don't know anything about it. And no one goes there really. Why, what are you excited for most? I don't know, the same thing. I don't know what to expect either. Best is when we go into that with no expectations of what's gonna happen. Yeah, like I can't give a picture of like That's why the island was so great. What I'm gonna see when we get there. I just, I don't know. I know, like on the island we ate bat. Yeah, but like we're sweating. Not eating a bat in China. No, hell no. Did you guys see Bad Bunny announced as the Super Bowl halftime show? Yes. What do you think about that? Pretty stupid. I'm not happy about it. I mean, it's just, I get what they're trying to do and get a whole new audience, get the Latinos in there, but it's pretty stupid. I know he's huge. Like he's huge. Bad Bunny's massive, girls love him. He's dated Kendall Jenner, but like, I just, I fucking hate Bad Bunny's music. He fucking sucks. Well, it's a time and place type thing. Bad Bunny's music sucks. That's how you're not cultured. If you're in the right- I don't give a shit. I know, that's what I'm saying. I'm not, and I'm not hating. In my personal opinion, I fucking hate Bad Bunny's music. I never want to hear it. You know why, dude? That's why you can't catch the vibe because you guys will play Flowrider and fucking Justin Bieber's old songs on a bus with a bunch of Latino women, and if you play Bad Bunny, it's a whole better vibe. Don't even compare Justin Bieber. No, there's not the same. It's a time and place. Don't compare Justin Bieber to Bad Bunny. I don't want to be your fucking baby on the way home when I'm like with a couple of Latinas with me. If I have Bad Bunny, I know it's, this is why we always, this is why we have to stay up till 6 a.m. and no one gets laid. Because you guys control the aux and play bullshit. You're never with Latinas. Not as much as I used to be. But I used to be a lot. But no, just for me, Bad Bunny too, it's also my, like I'm not, I can't dance. Dude, aren't you Canadian? Yeah. Okay, so you don't know what it's like to be an American and American NFL is about gambling, fear, football, and zaps, honestly. What does that have to do with Bad Bunny? He doesn't fit that narrative at all. I'm agreeing with you. I don't want to. Like a flyover with Bad Bunny? I'm agreeing, bro. Yeah, but I feel like you want to see like Tate McCray up there. I'd rather see Tate McCray, yes, dancing around, singing fucking Run for the Hills. I want to see like the Eagles up there, bro. You'd rather see Bad Bunny dancing around there than Tate McCray? If I was in the audience. Tate McCray would be a hype Super Bowl performance right now. Yeah, maybe. I know Latin music's huge, but I just, I'm so useless when it comes to Latin music. Like I can't dance too, so it's like, what the fuck am I gonna do? You gotta get out of your comfort zone. I can't understand the words. I can't dance to it. Can you understand future? Little bit. Not really, but it's a vibe when you listen to it. What, you love future. Yeah, I know, but because there's a time and place. You're in favor of Bad Bunny. Or you're just like Bad Bunny with Latinas. Yeah. Okay. I've never seen you on a bus with Latinas. It's one of my fantasies. But yeah, I don't know. I'm just not fired up for that halftime performance at all. I can't name one Bad Bunny song. I don't think I can either. You can't, right? No. Fuck. Who would you want to see at the halftime? What was the litest one recently? Probably the west coast one? Dude, Linkin Park would be sick. Linkin Park would be fucking sick. Metallica or some shit like that. Right, just legendary. Legendary bands. I like when they bring back the legendary. Yeah. Who would you like to see at the CFL halftime? I don't watch CFL. No? No. Who's the best team in the CFL? I have no idea. No? No. I've never watched a CFL game in my entire life. That's how it goes on over there. Who do you think is gonna be at the Super Bowl this year? The Ravens. Really? Aren't they playing like shit? The Mars is just so fucking good, dude. You think Ravens? I actually, nevermind. The Lions are fucking good. Lions are nasty. And it's just hard to rule out the Chiefs too. But they're not, they haven't been playing well either. How about Bills? Nah, they never make it. They just won't get it done? Yeah. Steelers are looking good. If Cleveland would start Shador, the Browns would fucking play. Fuck, what are you, man. What's good over there, man? I don't know. It's actually crazy. Yeah. I find it kind of crazy now. So, Dylan Gabriel's now the starter. Right. And I think Shador's getting a lot of like shit right now because he did that interview where he didn't say anything. Yeah, he went on mute. Did you see that? Yeah. I can't agree with that. Well, what did they want him to say? What you should say is, I want what's best for the team and I respect the coach's decisions. Like something PR trained. Like James Winston's answer. And then just get back to playing. But when you do that shit, I see what he's trying to do. He's like, no matter what I say, they're gonna twist it. But like doing that, you just look kind of like immature. And like, I don't know. He could have played it smarter. Are they ever gonna put him in, you think? Yeah. This season? Six or seven. You think? Yeah. Fuck, they're really making them grind it out out there. Have you been gambling on it? I did. I almost hit a fucking huge parlay last weekend. So it was four time. I was with Maddie Betts. Four time. What the hell was that scene like? It was good. I mean, we almost hit. Curtains were definitely shut. No, curtains were open. Okay. Four anytime touchdowns. I forget who the first two were. What did it pay? It was 6K to win 325. Crazy. So we hit the first two in the afternoon games. Both guys got touchdowns. And then it came down to the Cowboys and the Packers game. And it was Ferguson. He got a touchdown. Who you wish you were dating is one of the sisters. That's my boy by the way. Just kidding. Not really. And Ferguson and Kraft. Yeah. He went down at the one. On the Packers. And Kraft went down at the one, like yards for the first time. So that was the last sweat to win 325. Yeah. And then so that he went down with inches and then Ferguson hit the touchdown. Yeah. And then fucking Kraft hits the fucking pylon. With the ball? They call it a touchdown on the field and then they reversed it. They reversed it. So you thought you were good? We were freaking out. Oh my God. And then they reversed it. And then the game was over. And then they tied it with like 45 seconds left. I don't know if you're watching. Yeah, they tied it. And then it went to OT and then it ended in a fucking tie. I know. Why would they change that overtime rule to like, because they changed it this year, right? Yeah. I don't know why they did that. And why would they make it end in a tie though? It's so fucking lame. Yeah, it is lame. Do you think they should change that rule? I don't know. Because college is- A tie is better than a loss. So I guess it can help when it's all said and done. It's just a lame, no one wants to see it tie. Does college keep going? Yeah. They should just make it like that college. The thing is too, it could affect playoff, you know, pictures too later down in the season. So yeah. How pissed were you when you got reversed? I was pissed. And what was Jimmy's cut of the 325? I put 2K into that. So everyone put their little bit in. I think Jimmy put a grand, so he would have won like 70K. Oh my God. Yeah, I would have won like 150. You were in that too. I was in that. I lost a thousand. It was crazy, bro. I had a thousand and went 10. I really- I'm putting in these circles of fucking parlay's. You don't live in Miami. That you guys are almost hitting. Let's fire tonight on the game. Who is it tonight? Rams and Niners. Okay, what's your big UFC parlay you want to stop talking about? Give it to the fans. I think this is a fucking lock as a parlay. I really do. And I don't always, I never- Cause people always ask me like, who you got, who you got, who you got? They're gonna come for you if you're wrong. Well, I'm pretty confident in this one. I just don't see how this doesn't hit. So, Ko-Main and Main. I think Onkelayev beats Pereira. I think Pereira is great. I think he's had his time a little bit. Onkelayev beat him last time. He's a fucking Russian wrestler. Those guys are just tough to beat. And then, I mean, Marab is Marab. He's fighting Sandhagen. I think, I mean, I'm pretty sure Marab's gonna win that. Put them together, pays minus 135. Well, how much are you putting? I don't know, I'm gonna decide. Well, I'm going to Vegas tomorrow. You said 100 grand. Are you coming? We'll see. I think we have to pressure you right now to lock that in. You want to do 100? No, I'm not gonna, you do 100. I mean, dude, I'm pretty confident. Just announce that you're gonna do it because now I want to pressure you into doing it. I got 60K cash on me. So maybe I'll do that for sure. Yeah, 50 minimum. 50 minimum. What is it Marab to win and? Marab parlay with Onkelayev. To win. Yeah, minus 135. So 10K pays like seven something. Yeah. A thousand pays 700-ish. Okay. I think that's a good return. That's a lock, bro, yeah. I think it's good, bro. I like pairing two really good favorites together for parlayes in UFC. Not too many. You don't want to parlay too many on UFC. Do you really see Marab losing any time? No, that one I don't ever see losing. But I'm in it for the day, bro. That's what makes the UFC insane is that like, you never know. Like Sandhagen. Well, I could see Pereira easily catching him in that happening, but Marab, I don't ever see losing to anybody. I know, but they went five rounds last time and Magomed had kind of the better of it. You know what I mean? I mean, he won. You know what I'm saying? So I just think, yeah, it's like you said, he kind of had his time. The wrestlers, bro. The wrestlers. I know, but what about fucking when we were sweating, what's his name? Marab's a wrestler. It was against Leon Edwards. Leon Edwards caught him with the leg, the face. It happens. That could happen, but I'm going to put my bet more towards a consistent guy that made, you know what I mean? Like those Russians are fucking hard to beat, dude. Yeah. Like they win most of the time. How old is he? The Russian, I'm not sure. How old is Pereira? Isn't he a little older? He got started late. Yeah, I'm not sure how old he is, but he's just kind of, you know, he's had his superstar time too. Yeah. I think in the UFC, once you kind of reach that superstar level and then you lose, it's kind of hard to like. Make the comeback. I can't imagine how hard it is to stay hungry. Yeah. As a fighter too. Like look what we do too. It's tough to kind of stay hungry. Imagine being a fighter where it's like. You're getting hit in the face. You got to really want it. You got to be training every day. That's why I'm mime this guy so much. I just don't understand because a lot of these guys, like they're done at like 35. Like what do they do? They're not, they're not, they don't make enough money to retire. Most of these guys, right? I'm not sure. I'm not sure how much they're making. I've always wondered that because I've seen DC always talks about how he made a lot of money like back in the day when he was fighting John Jones. He was like, I'd make a lot of money, but you always hear the other side where it's like, these fighters don't get paid enough and then they only fight a few times and they're done. I think all the guys that really were champs, like in this recent era, I think, I mean. They're good? Yeah, I think they're good. Yeah, they're. I mean, they're all doing podcasts. Most of them are doing podcasts too. And they're talking about flights. Yeah, that's true. You know, Demetrius Johnson and Rampage Jackson. So what are those guys? Like, yeah, like Rampage is like a full-time streamer now, but like, so if this is. Yeah, so in that era, I doubt they were making as much as obviously they are now. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, Dana says it all the time too. Like anyone can come out and say how much they make, but. Well, people keep asking Dana, how's the new payment structure gonna work with the Paramount deal? And his response is like, they'll be taken care of. But if the UFC or if this White House is fought on CBS, so it's no paywall. Right. Where does the purse come from? Who knows if that's gonna be free? That might be behind Paramount Plus too. Like, cause Connor's claiming he's gonna make a hundred million. No, I don't think so. Right? I don't think so. All right, I wanna tell you guys about Shopify.

Why didn't the NFL get, why don't they get like, wouldn't it be smart to get Taylor Swift? For the halftime? Yeah. Wouldn't that just be the smartest move you could do? Maybe it would just be too obvious though, right? Obvious how? Plus they already have the Taylor Swift audience. I guess, yeah, you're right. They're already getting that. The NFL is very calculated. Yeah, and at the end of the day, it's like people like us will complain about Bad Bunny, but that's why they have Bad Bunny too, because it's like, like you said, they're trying to bring a different audience that probably wouldn't watch the Super Bowl. Like I'm sure a lot of Latina girls that love Bad Bunny and I'd never be able to fucking get in my life, they're gonna be watching the Super Bowl. There'll be the most 2C done at any Super Bowl with Bad Bunny performing. 2C dealers are gonna be up that day, I promise you. Because everyone in like South America and shit's gonna be watching it. The whole fucking city of Miami is just gonna be pink. Yeah. Right? I'm not coming to Miami with that. You're gonna be like, the US government's gonna be able to see it from the drones, and they're just gonna look down and just see like pink powder. Everywhere. All over the city of Miami. We gotta stay out of Miami for the Super Bowl then, right? Yeah, where is it? I don't know, where is the Super Bowl? San Francisco, oh hell no. What do you guys think about the, like how every relationship now, if the girls like kind of pop in, the MLB, the NFL just puts them on. I mean, I said this last week, yeah, Taylor Swift kind of changed the game, right? I think she laid out the roadmap for singers and like female personalities. Travis and Jason got paid too, so good for them. They're making, that's the relationship to get in. If you can get in a relationship where a chick can just make you money by being with her, that's the best thing ever. So they're getting married, right? Yeah. Does Taylor Swift make him sign a prenup? I feel like she doesn't believe in a prenup, to be honest, which is why Travis is just moving different. Do you think that would hurt your ego a little bit if you like- Married a chick richer than you? No, no, no, so take about this. You're in love with, you lock up one of these girls we just named, whatever. Yeah, you're like laughing while you say that. You lock her up, you're happily in love. You know she's rich. I think it's funny how you think your wheelhouse is so much like bigger than mine, but go ahead. When did I say that? No, you're just kind of like trying to like laughing and smiling at me and shit, but go ahead. No, I'm saying you lock up a girl, right? She's obviously richer than you. And then she like sits you down one day and says like, hey, we need to talk. And you like think she's breaking up with you. And then she's like, you need to sign a prenup. Ah. I mean, it makes me think. It would make me think different. I'm trying to think. Don't you think if you asked a chick that, she would think different too? I'd be like, damn. Like more like, you bring this up. No, but stereotypically, obviously it's way more common, I'm assuming for females to sign a prenup, right? But would that really, I'm trying to think. There's a funny, you guys won't get this reference, but there's a funny curber enthusiasm. Have you ever seen that? Larry David is a comedian, but he goes to dinner with this couple and the guy in the relationship gets the bill and he thanks the guy and the woman's all offended. And she's like, why wouldn't you thank me too? Like we're in a relationship, what's mine is his. And he's like, no, it's not. And like he goes off. But back to what you're saying is that if you told a girl that, she was probably gonna be offended and think about it too. No, if it's a girl's money, it's their money. If it's my money, it's ours. I agree with you, but I'm saying, if you sit down with a chick and you say, hey, you're gonna have, like, I wanna talk to you about something, I want you to sign a prenup. She's probably gonna like think about it for a little bit. No, yeah. I'm just saying, I wonder how that would feel. Cause like, I'm wonder if that's going down. Travis has his own money though. Taylor Swift obviously has a fucking powerhouse business team. Well, yeah, she's a billionaire. I'm sure they're also telling her like, yo, you gotta make them sign a prenup. Imagine that, that's content if you record that conversation right there. They gotta live stream that. Taylor's gotta live stream that. Travis, I wanna talk to you real quick. Do you think you could date a girl richer than you? Yeah, I don't see any scenario where I'd ever be able to get that, but if it's out there, I would do it. Well, you don't think that could ever happen? Oh, I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I don't, like, they'd have to be an artist or some shit. What about you? They'd have to have some real cheddar too. Like, let's not get that twisted. I don't know. I was like, well, yeah, I mean, that's the other thing. I'm trying to think about it cause you do kind of lose, right? Like you lose the edge a little bit. You do, yeah. It's also gonna be a problem for you because me and Selim, like, we're still eating the crumbs and you gotta find someone that's worth a few hundred million. A few hundred million? Yeah. A little less than that probably, but. I think I could. Depends, I mean, if she's that rich too, it's probably gonna be like a superstar, like you said. So she's obviously just gonna be a smoke show. So you kinda have to, right? Yeah, I just think we gotta just accept defeat and come back to reality. That's probably not gonna happen for us. Yeah, like, who's like, like, there's like, I guess the richest girls are like Kim K, like, Sidney Sweeney's probably rich as fuck. Actually, you know what's fucked up though is now a lot of them are probably OnlyFans chicks. God forbid I ever marry a OnlyFans chick, then I'm getting half that bread. If I'm gonna deal with that shit, I'm getting half that money. You know what I'm saying? If you're gonna date me and have an OnlyFans, I'm coming for half the cheddar. If I gotta have my homies making jokes at night, I gotta see that shit, yeah, half that shit's mine. Do you not agree with me? I agree. Could you see yourself dating the only, I mean, marrying one? Yeah, I dated him before. No, marrying, I mean, marrying one, like. It'd be really fucking hard, but if it's presented, there's no prenup. You think at some point you just think I can't do this? I'm gonna do it for a year, get my share, rob her ass, and move on with my life. If you had, double my net worth real quick. Would you rather date a stripper or OnlyFans girl? OnlyFans, yeah. Yeah. Cause like, I don't know. If you're meeting him at the strip club too, that's probably not gonna be a healthy relationship. Would you marry a retired stripper? I mean, dude, if I have a connection with somebody, which is the most important thing. Like, you know when you go to the strip club and you fall in love with the girl and you like, kind of think for a second. I've never been that guy in my life. Really? Yes. Maybe when I was like 19, yeah. You never fell in love with the strip club, like for like a few hours? Dude, we've all had that homie that's been like, yo, she really fucks with me. Yeah. Yeah. I can't lie, I try to be, I'm kind of that guy sometimes too. Yeah. Like, you gotta believe it for a bit, right? Like, you're like, yo, I think she was kinda into me, like. Well, yeah, you want that. That's her job. They're good at that. They're great at it. Yeah. There is that homie though, that always thinks the stripper. Yeah, it's embarrassing. Like, she wanted me, dude. She really, we really like. You know who that was? Nino. No, shocker. Shocker. Nino's coming to. He's the guy that's texting them for fucking weeks on end. Yeah. It's been two years wishing him happy birthday. It's like, dude, give it up. What's the ideal profession for a girl that you marry? I don't know. Teacher. One, two, then I'll, that's good. Teacher's nice. Nurse. Students, bro. Great, and then when you have children. Teacher. A nurse is great, cause like. Who that I will never is real estate, cause then you know they, that's not a real job. And. They're getting pounded in those houses. That's what a bottle service chick does on the side. Every girl now that could be doing OnlyFans or used to be doing OnlyFans does real estate now. Mm-hmm. Yeah. You know what I mean? Cause one, I don't know, they need to make real estate licenses harder to fucking obtain. You know what they say, make podcast equipment more expensive, which they probably should too. Maybe for us even too, but real estate licenses, they need to be harder to fucking obtain. Yeah. Because every girl that I see now that just wants to do something with their life, they get into fucking real estate. I know. And it's like. It's a real thing. You're not selling a fucking house. Like I'm not buying a fucking house with you. You're not selling my house, and I'm not buying a house with you. You never bought a house, right? No. Do you have a real estate agent in Miami when you do rentals? Yeah. Are they good negotiators? She was good. Yeah. Her name's Kim. She's like a MILF. Oh, so you had a good experience. Actually, she's like a gilf almost, right? Is she a grandma? What does that mean? Is she a grandma too? No. Yeah. So she's a gilf. She's hot. Okay. Shout out Kim. She's married, but yeah. Shout out Kim. So nurse is an ideal. Teacher. Teacher's good. Nurse is great too, cause they wear the slacks and shit. Like, you know, they probably kiss you good, bought the scrubs. Like they're kissing you goodbye, going to work with their scrubs. Teacher's great too. Teachers are- Two things I've never, my wife's not doing. No tennis instructor. Oh, hell no. Right? Yeah, I could see that happening too. What the fuck? I just said that's why that's not happening. My girl's not having a fucking male tennis instructor. That shit's not gonna happen. Cause every tennis instructor I know is like a beauty. Right? They're in good shape. They're good at tennis. That's not gonna happen. Instructors are out. Personal trainers. Yeah. No. What else is a no? What's off limits when you have a wife for her to do? Off limits. You, Saleem would be very- What? Bring out that inner tate. About what? No, you'd have a long list for sure. Yeah, I mean, it wouldn't be crazy. It just, I'd be on watch. So I'd be on watch. You gotta watch. What? You gotta watch, you gotta observe. Have you let a girl ever have your location? Cause that, you lose a relationship the moment you let that happen. You can never let the girl, yeah, once you let the girl have your location, you're screwed. I'm pretty good at swindling out of it. For me too, it's just like- You gave it up a couple times? I've never given it. I don't think so, bro. Has a girl gone through your phone? Yes, not by choice. Okay. By choice is just as bad as getting up your location. My eyes were never open. I was usually sleeping. Oh, they did that to you? Yeah. The sleep scan? Sleep scan. And you woke up getting strangled or what happened? No, plotting, plotting on it for weeks. Really? Yeah. I think she'd been doing it and continuing to fake the relationship. Not fake, but yeah. Can only imagine what she saw in there. That was a long time ago. That was a long time ago though. Halloween's coming up. Are we gonna do anything for Halloween this year? I don't know. We didn't really see that hyped up. We didn't do Halloween last year really. Did we? Did you? I don't even remember. Any costume ideas? Nah, I don't even, dude, I'm at a different level. Like I'm focusing on a relationship and a family. I'm not worried about Halloween costumes and Sandy shit. Really? Yeah. You want to start a family? Maybe. No, I'll be in a costume out in Halloween. You'll be in the whole week. Buzz Lightyear? I'll bring back Buzz Lightyear. That was a good one for me. You and Gabe? It should be Woody. He could be Mr. Potato Head. Yeah, he could be Mr. Potato Head. Speaking of rich girls, Elon Musk just officially, I think his net worth was like officially got to over $500 billion. Who verifies that? I don't know. I saw it on the fucking news. Who knows if it's true. But what would you do? Like what's the first thing you would do if Musk just hit you up and said, yo, by the way, that pod you did fucking, me and you did that like three years ago, it was amazing. Here's a billion. What's the first thing you would do with a billion dollars right now? Take care of my homies. First thing I'm doing. I don't know what you guys are doing, but each one of my family members getting probably a hundred grand. That's it? Throw you 10, Sleem 10. Shit. And then yeah, none of you talk to me anymore. I'm moving on. That's it, a hundred grand? No, no, my family, I'll give them each probably like 10 million. Okay, besides giving back, like what's- Cause I just wanna see, like I don't say it, but like some people gave, called you cheap. So I was just curious, like what would you do? How much would you give your homies? I mean, at least a million each. The homies? Yeah. Okay. A billion dollars? Yeah. Yeah, that's a thousand million, right? Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's, yeah. I don't know, dude, I don't know. I would definitely fucking fall off the face of the earth. You think? Yeah. I mean, you'd probably, you'd party for sure though. For the first month or two, going on a generational run. Realistically, after you do your giving back and your philanthropy, you're booking, you're grabbing a jet. Of course. Somewhere. Yeah. And where are you going? Probably- Like eventually you're gonna celebrate. A Moffey Coast. Yeah, Dana's gonna be there and I'm gonna get a yacht that is two times the size of his. If fucking Leo's there, I'm gonna have a bigger one and just flex for a week. Honestly, maybe just spend all of it and go on a run. Yeah, fuck, the billion dollars would be fucked. What the hell would you do, sleep? I don't know. You'd just go to the range. Well, I'd get back to, I mean, but now I'd probably buy a jet, first thing. Probably a sick jet. That we could just all ride on and shit. I mean, if you have, what, how many? You said a billion? Yeah. I feel like I'd be in such shock for having it. Like, what the fuck do I do with this, right? I'm gonna be honest, I don't think that much changes for certain people. Doesn't, right? Like when Elon has, when he's worth a billion and he's worth 500 billion, you think he moves that different? After a billion, what else? I mean, that's so much money. Yeah. Like 100 million's like 50 million. How do you even have $500 billion? I don't know. Like, how's that even possible? I don't get it. And what is that, like crypto, cash, assets, everything? How does that make sense? I wouldn't wanna have that much money. That's like too much responsibility, bro. People come for you and shit too. So much fucking, that'd be crazy. Have you guys seen this video of Morgan Wallen? So he, when he got arrested, he was in the- The back of the cop car? Yeah, I've seen it. He was in the back of the cop car and his song comes on in the cop car. With a, I think it's Mama's House with Thomas Rhett, comes on in the cop car. That's fucking, that's badass. Do you ever watch the body cam shit? It comes out for everybody who like this, which is scary, every artist out there. But I watch, have you watched this shit on Luke Bryan? No. Where he like fought, was it gonna fight some other country singer and he climbs up a gate and it's a barbed wire and he just puts his hands down on the barbed wire and jumps it and he's ready to fight this guy. That's crazy. Wait, that's not, isn't that, wasn't that Zach Bryan? Yeah. Oh. Yeah, Zach Bryan. Oh. So you did see that, yeah. I thought you said, well you said Luke Bryan. My bad. Oh yeah, what the fuck's up with Zach Bryan, bro? I don't know, but the country guys like actually, I think just like don't give a fuck. Yeah. Do you like Zach Bryan's music? Yeah. See, that's another guy and I'm not hating again. Super successful, like I know I've seen his concerts. I heard he's amazing live too. I think he's got pretty good music. I just don't really like his music that much. Chicken Fry is a good friend, so I support her, but and that whole beef, but he's got good songs. I can't get into his music. Like to me, I don't know if they're even comparable, but I'm sure people compare them, but like Morgan Wallen and Zach Bryan to me is not even comparable. Dude, those guys, are they friends? I don't think so. I feel like the country is the only lane where like no one gets along with each other. I think there's just, I think it's just friendly competition, but I think Morgan Wallen's like miles better than Zach Bryan in my opinion, but I know Zach Bryan's super successful. He fucking, his shows are insane. Guy sells out fucking huge. I think he did a show with like 110,000 people. Who just did a show in Michigan? Yeah, that was him. Yeah, did you see on the thing he had the Portnoy? No. I don't know if it was one urinal or all of them, but Portnoy posted it and there was like the thing on the urinal, the splash pad thing. Yeah. It was a photo of Portnoy's face, like a custom splash pad of Portnoy's face. What the fuck? Yeah, but I don't know. I guess it was off a random TikTok account, so Portnoy accused him of like getting someone to take that video themselves and posting it on TikTok for it to go viral. I didn't see all that, but selling out an arena with 110,000 people is insane. Crazy work. You sell out 110,000 people. Yeah, I don't know. But he's beefing in that other country guy now, right? Gavin? Yeah, that's what I was talking about. I don't know what the hell's going on. I just watched these country beefs and it's fucking pure entertainment. We need more country beefs. Yeah. Zach Bryan's definitely like, he's definitely like a hothead though, right? For sure, he's definitely gotta be entertaining to be around, but he's definitely a hothead. Guy definitely goes nose down to the table, right? Sure. Yeah, if you're hot, he hopped over a barbed wire fence. Yeah, it's fucking crazy. You can't do that if you're not on cocaine. No way. Right? I don't think so. You can't just be drunk to hop over it. Like you're gonna feel it. If you're drunk, you're gonna feel the barbed wire. If you're blowed out, I think like you probably wouldn't feel it. Yeah. Like how do you hop over a barbed wire fence? I don't know. I watched that and I was like, what the hell is good with this guy? Yeah, and that other guy's like fucking huge, right? Yeah. All right, so what do we got going on this weekend? So we're off to Vegas. You guys, oh, you're coming? So you're at Summits at Live Beach, right? Yes. John Summits at Live Beach Saturday. Oh my God. We haven't stepped out in a minute, all the boys, right? Excited. I'm excited.

That's my lock. Okay. I'm gonna lock it in at the Red Rocks. I want to. I think Magomed Marab. I think Magomed. I think Magomed TKOs in this time. Salim is a fated god on UFC. I'm very bold. You're the fated god on UFC. And I think Marab. I think Marab by decision. And I think Onkaleyev by TKO. I think he finished. There you have it. This time, like fourth. We're off to Vegas. We're off to China. We're off to Japan this weekend. We got Skip Bayless. We're about to do him on the pod. So that's gonna be out next week. Yeah. I'm excited for this. Yeah.
