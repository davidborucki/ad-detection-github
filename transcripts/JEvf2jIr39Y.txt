What's some of your fondest memories of you growing up on the east side of Chicago? Going to play basketball at Ekasau Park Playing basketball at South Shore Park playing basketball at Woodhull Park where it's like I'm from I Grew up all over the east side You know I'm saying like it's not a lot of people that could really say They have memories more so in other areas other than they blocked a little two block radius They grew up on that's all you could see I thought you couldn't see outside of anything Oh, they're not for sure But the east side is pretty big and I got memories like all over because I got my aunts like lived in different parts of neighborhood I actually went to school and a neighborhood that wasn't where I lived it You know I'm saying so it's like I had friends over there And I had friends in my neighborhood where I live so my fondest memories are just being able to walk 12 blocks to go play basketball if I'm saying like I Definitely look back and think and a lot of those people who I share those memories with not here no more. Yeah Outside of rap did you dream of anything else other than rap or that was that you know? My brother used to tell us tells me all the time. He said a dream is a gift that we give to ourselves Mm-hmm. I never heard it so Outside of rap you say you know you started 15 16 outside when you growing up say you're 9 10 11 12 What did you hurt? I want to play basketball you want to yeah, I want to go D1 and go And I wasn't like when I was young I didn't really get good at basketball until I got like eighth grade ninth grade Okay, like I just had a dream I wanted to do it because it was the cool thing to do right my big cousins and big brother and all and play Basketball and they was good, you know and I just want to like follow after them for real I really like I used to like believe that I could do it for real. You know, I'm saying like I got you could really who? Yeah, I'm nice. I'm cool for sure. Right sure for sure Like well my dreams just got cut short so early right 15 16 out freshmen Southmore high school I got shot got kicked off the team stuff like that You found sense so it's like I just lean towards rap But I never wanted to be anything other than the basketball playing the rapper. Did you play any other sports? Football you try I never tried football man I just like I just fell a little basketball and just only played basketball like I wasn't athletic at all I'm not gonna lie to you like so who would you compare your basketball game to you? You LeBron you stealth curry you KD you know, you're gonna laugh at this for real for you know Who they used to compare me to Oh van X I Used to say I was I used to play like that next because I could like I used to be in like you lefty Yeah, I'm left hand. Okay, get the web a spot like so connected quick I was I was in there when he got there he was he was nice with the right He could he was he could dance with it nice. I was nice and my Prime is prime So obviously if you're from Chicago, you know D Rose, yeah for sure D Rose people say man D Rose is Probably bigger in Chicago to Jordan. I've said that before You said that my own mouth. I said that with you. I said man you didn't get the boy I don't know you must be drinking when you drink it when you said that let me give you my opinion on why Okay, you give me your opinion. I'm not gonna like Jordan is the biggest of the biggest. I'm yeah say it but it's like Coming from Chicago D Rose homegrown know he homegrown is like we seen it like I used to watch him play When he went to Beasley, I knew who Derek Rose was Oh from Beasley to Simeon you feel me like yes That's why I felt like it just made it like any kid from Chicago. They dream like you could do it We really watched D Rose do it and become one of the greatest point guards to ever play in the NBA Youngest MVP he just gave us so much hope in Chicago. You found saying they gotta think about it I was born in 95 so I ain't really get to see Jordan play right so highlights I seen dead rose in real time. Yeah, you're right about that. So that's what I meant. Oh, I mean clear Yeah, come people like but hello, bro How you gonna say D Rose but I get what you're saying because you're talking about a guy from Chicago poverty Struck a bitch grew up poor bro and became one of the biggest to ever play the game in my opinion What is D Rose trajectory if he doesn't get hurt if he doesn't hurt that knee and we saw him become the youngest MVP in NBA history, so his trajectory was like Mm-hmm. Now he a he's a phenomenal player. Yeah, but I still think we were robbed of him at his absolute prime Absolutely. We definitely got robbed of Derek Rose You know I'm saying it's like that's why we so passionate about it because we know What it would have been if he didn't hurt himself like you can't tell me that Derek Rose wouldn't have left the NBA without no reason He would have left the NBA without no rings. You from Sam. Okay, we heard yourself, you know, because he was just so good They would have especially what the NBA is now and what it was what it was becoming They would have built a team around him. He would have had a dynasty around him for real for it like Every you can't tell nobody in Chicago that Derek Rose is not top three point guard ever right still right I'm saying like and that's that's how I feel about him like for sure What is it about? Hoopers and athletes want to be rappers rappers want to be Hoopers and football player what what what what is the combination? What is the common thread? What is the fabric that tie these together? I think it's just like the cool it factor. You know I'm saying like the lifestyle that Rappers their artists live is like it's glamorized. It's looked upon is like fun and athletes Really like they life is discipline structure. Yes gym workout You know the the athlete that go to the club and party like a artist he get criticized the most you know I'm saying but at the end of the day I feel like they just want to have that kind of form because they really got more money than us They got more money than us, but we have it more fun, right? So it's like I feel like that's the whole like thing that tied to each other and you got to think about Like just the motivation and inspiration that we give them with our music and our art You know I'm saying I'm working out in the gym listening to it and get them in a mold like it's certain songs that you listen To like I'm gonna go school 40 to like right I'm saying I think that's really like the Bridge in between it and a lot of artists like myself We had hoop dreams or football dream right what we did is so it's like we look up to them, too Because they are what we wanted to be but it ain't work out Rap was I playing me you feel me they play a work If I gave you a choice say you know what you could have went to the NBA or you'd be the rapper Would you trade your career your rap career to be in the NBA? No no What they are what you wouldn't because I feel like early on I thought that's what I was like Destined to do but I really feel like I'm living in my purpose now like with all the people that are influenced and what my music is It's not really just like rap for me like the greatest feeling that I get from this is when people tell me like you Changed my life wow you got me through this situation like my brother passed my grandmother my dad passed And like if it wasn't for your music. I don't even know what I would be what I would be doing and Don't get me wrong you could you could influence those kind of people through you know Sports and stuff like that, but I just feel like I was really meant to be who I am right now, right all right hoop rappers you Jay Cole Savage Drake yeah Dave East Breezy now it's reported that you beat Drake and Savage yeah Yeah, we did no you know Drake times in a row hold on great like I've seen be I haven't seen it with my own eyes But I watched him in the video and Drake got gang Drake to shoot the net off them with for sure Hey, you beat you yeah, you be sad to play the five on fire. Yeah, Drake and Savage on the same team Oh your team beat his team that we beat them for sure like four five time. Yeah Yeah, for sure and we'll do it again. Yeah Y'all have some money on the line. We ain't even play for no money We was just playing for foreign for the sport we just really take it serious They got money on the wood and I we put that money on the wood for sure we could play for that money They got a lot of For sure but now that's my dog man 21 that's my brother Drake. We just had the career vibe and it whooping and shit We beat they asked like four five times in a row Who's idea wasn't gonna come man? Y'all? Okay, y'all in there y'all talking y'all you doing your thing y'all problem studio man Somebody started talking man. Hey, hey, you know how I be like They get the wolf like I bet come on suit up like Suit up everybody come on suit up for sure like niggas bringing hoop shoes like what size you will you will now? I go give me bring me another man Shit like this you now I Don't know about y'all really but I've seen Chris Brown Chris Brown can really nice. He nice to we played Chris Brown in the crew league We lost them. Yeah. Yeah, I figured I figured that I was gonna say that but I think it is now We lost the breezy team for sure every time we went to the crew lead. We made it to the finals Though we always made it to the championship There's been a lot of talk and I know you didn't probably get an opportunity to see him at its prime I did Michael Jackson a lot of people say Chris Brown is the greatest entertainer Ever that title has been bestowed to Michael for a very long time now We know when it comes to album sales record sales. Nobody's gonna be able to approach Mike He's a he that that's first of all, they don't sell vinyl they don't sell records like that anymore So that's null and void but do you believe that Chris Brown is the greatest entertainer? I feel like there's nobody closer to Michael Jackson than Chris Brown, right? Honestly like for real for real and just seeing it with my own eyes, you know and just seeing like Who he is as a person and putting your whole everything into your crap, right? So like he really like it's mind-blowing seeing him on stage, right having all that energy Yeah, his hits like being in shape what you could do with 30 flips back to back You know saying like yeah two hours two and a half hours of that night tonight Insane for 50 nights in a row and you can go do it again You can go do it it out the country you could do it and I'm saying like yeah Breezy Definitely in my opinion is the closest thing to Michael Jackson for sure. How was it working with Breezy? So what's he like in the studio? What's it like? You know, you like you said he's an unpenomenal performer Performer you can sing he can dance There's not a dime mean I don't even know if he got bones in his body the way he can get his body Do all that stuff. He did my knees hurt. I'm gonna have to get my knees replaced just watching the videos I got me of replace, you know, like some people just like have that it factor If I'm saying like some people is really like God really put their hands on you and just made you this is what I want You everything you do. Yeah, I'm saying in that in that field Yeah And that's the same thing with like with him in the studio Like the way he record is second nature when he in his comfort zone Like he wants you to come pull up on him come to the crib come where I'm at right and like like just bad and it's gonna it's gonna like It's gonna have the same outcome every time if I'm saying like he not gonna miss it's just what he do you feel me like and when I seen that like it's only certain people that I ever seen in my life who I feel like I just like Amazing at making music. I'm saying and that's that's Chris Brown juice world future Meek Mill and those the only people that are really singing one on that's like this shit really is second nature to them I'm saying like and it inspired me to like Get better you guys get my game up bad It's so it inspired me to like just cuz I'm like a sponge though when I watch people do certain things I'll pick up from you know, I'm saying the way they record and they patterns like you feel I'm saying like I give example like meet me he Freestyle a bunch of different flows and like cadences until he just find that one day He the most comfortable with and just go off of that, right? Pluto do the same thing for real in his own way. It's like he just keep on like he just edit He just spin shit it sound like he mumbling at first, right? when you hear it and it all put together that shit sound like amazing and I seen juice world do the same thing with his music like juice used to I've never seen nobody do a juice world do though juice would wrap a full song And one tape like without punching in like he would wrap a really a full song To verses all in one take without stopping and stop and wrap another song Completely different on the same beat one take he'll do it at least three four times. Damn. It just picked his favorite one I've never seen nobody do that in my life ever So what look I've had a lot of people on the show and it's like, you know, hove you play hova beat Hoes in the back. He's real quiet. He's just nodding his head Then he go in boom do his thing face say like why he's listening to the beat he's right Wayne don't write anything down. He just go drop the track. What's your style? I'm kind of like a mixture between like what ho and what Wayne do like I'm quiet like Southside Southside is my brother man. He been producing me since I was 16 years old I heard him like like, you know, you be focused on thinking in my head like that's how I do in my head I don't write I haven't wrote no song in probably Four five years right for real So it's like I just be in there vibing and my off the top of my head I'm saying the lyrics in my head though Like I'm thinking of it at least the first four to eight bars Then I go in and whatever I memorized I say and from now just pick on and punch in like like how Wayne do Right, but I'm talking about Southside I heard him say like because they're being there making a beat and I just be like nodding They be like, yeah somebody asked like when he gonna go in there he like bro He rapping already in his head like he already Wow He like he noticed that I did before I even was noticing like I just think it shit But you like you always do that Like I just be in that vibe and in my head you would think I'm listening to the beat But I'm actually rapping like my first four to eight bars at least Wow going So you're not really paying attention not to what the beat is doing. You're thinking about what you gonna say over that exactly Exactly. Like so as they making the beat they produce it like I'm just letting them do them because I Know they gonna add more to it regardless. So it's like once I hear a sound or a loop I know if I want to rap on the beat the first four seconds of it You know I'm saying like I know how I want to come into it. So it's like I be in my head just Thinking the stuff thinking the flows and it don't take me long. Maybe after like 15 minutes or something ready to go rap Damn, so you don't get you don't get distracted because if I'm like thinking about something, you know, man be quiet Come on, man. Damn. No hell no You need that yeah, I do I love that type of energy and I think I've grown into that artist where it's like sometimes I might you know want to be in the studio by myself But majority of the time nine times out of ten, I want at least 10 15 people in this that's what I was gonna ask because Some like no, bro. I'm I want it quiet some guys look I want I want to file and I won't I won't chaos I want people just running around doing whatever y'all do a cuz that don't impact me Let's get it and it's by my music though. So it's like a conversation that we might be having in this room I might think of something and it inspired me to like put it on the song You feel I'm saying so it's like I actually like when it's a lot of people and people be loud and talking and laughing and shit Don't bother me at all. Can you turn your mind off because you know I've heard him says that like when he was in it He's like every time he was just thinking something that rhyme rhyme tick flick Nick Do you turn your mind off are you constantly trying to think of things that rhyme? Um No, I don't you know, I actually changed my whole style of like Rap a few years ago cuz one of my closest friends my best friend WAP. He told me like bro. I watched you rap from Your very first times in the studio till now and I know like when you thinking too hard about stuff Like I don't even think about metaphor stuff that rhyme. I don't think about Stories I need to tell he said just going up and vibe to the beat bro That's when you make your hardest shit like okay He told me like every time you overthink and one time I did a song me and 21 Savage was in the studio And this was like this is probably like four years ago And he like broke you thought too hard about that verse like you could have went way Crazy damn and I was in my head thinking like I didn't really like the verse for real, right? Okay, you've already there. I was already thinking like I didn't really like it I felt like I was frustrated thinking about too much shit because at that moment is like 21 so big as an artist. I want to put my heart and shit on this you from saying He's brought me to the studio to jump on it So I'm thinking like I got to get my fire as first and I shouldn't have been thinking like that I should have just been like I'm gonna just do me just going there and when he told me that I Never thought hard about my music again, and I feel like I just got better and better Is that common like you want to be and you know that they got some other five they got heat on that thing So you like I'm gonna be because you know, it's natural they're gonna compare man Who are they who had the hardest verse one that's right? Absolutely for sure You like all I know I might not be the hardest but I did damn sure you don't sound the weekend Yeah, I go in with that mentality already like I but I don't think about what I'm gonna say Okay, whatever's going on on the song I might just listen to the vibe the hook or a little bit like I barely listen to their verses once I listen to The hook and a little bit of the verse I just go in there and just start rapping and that shit come out like And you know what it is. I'm a real like critical think I think a lot I can't really turn my man off to stop thinking right so it's like when I get in my zone I just like rap and say whatever come to me right at that moment I'm like what I mean bad so if I could like make it make more sense for you is as an artist Instead of thinking about the last as they come soon as it gets your brain you start rapping you thinking about The end of the song like I want to like you thinking about shit before even come to what I'm gonna say next I don't do that no more like I just whatever come to my head and a lot of times I should think about like damn should I say this should I not say this right how does it go like get? How is this going? Like reflect on the world or certain things I say like damn has this gonna affect this person I might be talking about something to somebody like damn is this gonna offend people like I used to think like that all the time now I really just don't care like I don't even give a fuck about nothing I don't care how people gonna receive it or anything cuz at the end of the day is like this my art right so This is what you feeling at that time so hey you receive it how you receive it But this is how I feel I go with it and I feel like once I started thinking like that Like this I'm unstoppable like I never get right as block or nothing This episode is brought to you by prize picks you and I make decisions every day Being right can get you paid don't miss any of the excitement this football season on prize picks where it's good to be right It's officially that time of year you might lose hope in your team, but don't worry That's why we have prize picks to keep you going Week five of football was something special Tampa's come back Philly lost their first game don't even get me started on my Baltimore squad I'm feeling good about Baker Mayfield and the rest of the Tampa squad, but after this week's game I'm all in on breaker touchdowns more more more prize picks is simple to play Just pick more or less on at least two players stats if you get your picks right you could cash in Prize picks is the only app that offers you stacks meaning you can pick the same player up to three times in the same lineup Want to pick more on Baker Mayfield's past yards rush yards touchdowns now You can pick all of them in the same lineup only on prize picks download the prize pick app today Use code Shannon to get $50 in lineups after you play your first $5 lineup That's code Shannon to get $50 in lineups after you play your first $5 lineup prize picks It's good to be right if you want to try do you want to hear other people's verse on that track? Or do you like a give me let me let me come in when I come in and then whatever happens happen because you know Sometimes they might play Somebody that's on the track they might play that verse Did you hear it and then what have you ever recorded and then you heard somebody's not got to do mine over I like that's why I like to hear they shit. Okay I definitely like to hear don't send me no blanks on I'm gonna get offended a little bit like I'm gonna get mad cuz I don't do that Right. I'm saying like I feel like I gotta at least hear your verse to give me some type of direction Because I could be all over the place you want one subject of the song if I'm saying I feel like people do that Intentionally cuz they want to burn When they do that I'll be like no hell no, send me your verse you from saying I take long with the verse on purpose You feel so then they'll go ahead see you know Yeah, I take long with the verse on purpose and then it's like now I'm taking my time with it Cuz sometimes I will go in the studio and like play four bars I'm gonna do another song and then come back to this on and lay another four bars and lay eight bars or whatever Until I finish the whole verse like I've done that multiple times You got to send the whole verse Especially if I know that the song done already like hell no, I want you to send me everybody on it artists do that too No, so do it. Yeah, so say for instance If I'm about to do a song When meek Mill he has sent me his verse but Jada Kiss would be on the song already too so he wouldn't send me the Him personally, but artists right right right, right? It'll be other people in the song but they not sending a verse is like no I don't need to hear everybody that's on this before I lay my shit But so let's just say for the sake of argument you got four guys on a song Do you do it does it? Matter to you which sequence you go are you first you said it you third you finish up How does who determines the order the sequence in which um, I feel like whoever song it is and just like Rapid etiquette whoever got the hardest verse have to go less right first or less. You can't really go in the middle, right? I'm saying so I don't really mind though I won't be caring because I would feel like I'm a had you got that by anyway So it don't matter and and a lot of times they put me last on the verse for sure Usually always less I mean the first or less right sure, okay Let's go back to the beginning you said you born in Chicago East Side of Chicago Obviously you talked about having homies and people that you knew and you grew up with Not make it as far as you did What was that culture like the gang culture? When did you realize that you man? My life different. Yeah, then a lot of people that's my age that look like me They don't have to experience what I'm experienced when did you realize that Where you were definitely was gonna impact what you became? when I started traveling like when I started to actually see other places and go to other cities and I Started traveling doing shows and I was like 17 years old. Okay going to Rhode Island going to like Boston and seeing like damn this shit totally different way. It's who is everywhere. Don't get me wrong, correct In even like other cities in the Midwest like you from saying Minnesota and she like everybody got their hoods It's all like trenched out dangerous But Chicago is just totally different and the stuff that I grew up seeing I thought it was normal because everybody was doing it Like if I'm saying like you going to school like I seen my first guns and shit at school Like you know people going to school and having guns on them and I'm in fifth grade sixth grade You know, I'm so they having a different bit is off and then you look up at time you were a grade We got metal detectors because niggas know that you know people that brought guns to school and shit and like my first home like I it was like It didn't dawn on me that my life was so different and so chaotic until I started to see people from other places and like having conversations with people that was older than me that didn't really like That grew up in Chicago, but didn't grow up how we grew up that wasn't in the streets I'm saying like I lost some of my first friends when I was in like sixth grade Like that's when I started seeing people get killed and murdered and shit like alright, but bro. He went to my school He used to chop it up and we come back school next day like yes, so I'm so got killed You feel me like was that your first experience with death when you're in the like the sixth grade with with death with people getting killed Yeah murders. Yeah for sure like sixth grade fifth grade shit like that was like Somebody who you know cuz I had older older cousins and brothers and shit that went to my school I got an older brother and I got older cousin and it was like We was deep it was probably like nine of us that went to that school So like their friends and they gray you see people they hang out with like damn He just got killed before I'm saying it they come back to school people sad some other shit is like It was so normal like people just went on with their date and there may be a few months later this person got killed you know, and it's like I Didn't really like it didn't hit home for me until I got in like Seventh and eighth grade when I started to like people who I knew looked up to started to get killed You know I'm saying it was all like behind like street shit gang shit You from saying it wasn't no accidental shit is like damn you and it wasn't no car wreck It was yeah, yeah, somebody in somebody had a illness leukemia cancer something like that No hell no like somebody intentionally killed you so it's like it get to a point where You like damn on I can't become a victim of this shit That's what I wanted to ask you yeah, you said East Side is it's big but You need to see anybody gets really small is really some time But let me ask you this did you know anybody from the East Side that had made it out and became successful doing something because it's hard Being from rural South Georgia. We didn't see anybody We didn't know anybody that it made it to the NFL or we didn't have anybody come back and talk to us and give us You know all we saw was advertising Military looking for a few good men. Yeah, I ain't it Yeah, so I'm trying to get I'm trying to get up out of there, but that's not the route. I'm trying to go so When did you make it up in your mind say you know what I? See all this death happening around me. Mm-hmm. I ain't going that route mm-hmm Probably when I dropped out of school like I was still rapping and going to school and I had Like a little hood fame and you know the ride II from saying so it's like by the time I was 16 years old people actually Really know my name, okay, but at the same time I was in the streets, so that was bad Mm-hmm you from says like now it's to a point where I'm rapping I got videos on YouTube that got 20,000 30,000 views 40,000 100,000 views is picking up like for real like really picking up and those 100,000 views is picking up like for real like really picking up and those 100,000 coming from other cities and stuff like that too, but the majority of it is coming from Chicago So it's like I'm becoming a household name in Chicago.

I mean you supposed to gave my shit back But anyway, so look it was a hot like I said a hot summer day go outside of my block and we out there deep like deep deep probably like 50 60 of us now I'm saying in my hood was like packed So it's like we have be posted up on one block probably 20 30 people girls Yeah, we on the whole next block 20 30 people girls like it just rotate walking back and forth from stores it was one of them type of ass and we just out there chilling with a bunch of girls and shit and You know, it's so crazy like two of my homies had walked up on the corner and told me like hey I just seen some niggas riding with hoodies on and shit like you found saying they finna come Right through here. You feel me? Like he gave us a warning and everything He told me like move around stem from right here one of my homies who passed away lonely my homie cat man Marv a car he got He got like two girls right there I think he talking to and I was talking to one of the girls at the time and Another girl that was right.

I'm like now I'm gonna come right here So I told the girls like y'all move around just go to the corner type shit And they moved around but we never moved or we never like what damn you gave them the hands up and you eat your own warning, I Just stayed right there like and You know, it's so crazy like when it happened we always before it happened I mean we always like on this one block and the police pulled up right there and there's some shit like Everybody looked like they didn't even hop out in friskers They was like everybody lift y'all shirt up and just like to make sure we handle guns on right shit lift our shirt up and I went around a block and Lo and behold so as I get to the corner after I told the girls to move around They just pulled up shoot and I got hit and like me and like Eight other my homies like nine of us got that shows on newspaper article. Yeah, it's a crazy shit for sure Yeah, like nine of us got shot that day. Then you wish you'd had that thing on you, won't you? No, I of course for sure But I ain't gonna I'm gonna keep it a buck with you for real for real when that shit happened when the police pulled right there I threw my gun like owner like like in a in a field. Yeah, I'm just I'm what I had it on me 35 seconds before it happened like you feel me y'all saw him coming. So you saw the police coming? Yeah, you got rid of Yeah, Danny walked up like I want some lift y'all shirt up. But to be honest though, I feel like it was like Some shit were like it might have called the police like oh, yeah They write that standing with guns so we could get dispersed or whatever and then come around and do what they did type shit You feel I'm saying like I feel like it was a situation like that. Yeah Was that the moment that you realized you know what? Mad get a mad. I'm somebody now cuz like you said your music has started to take off You're not that you're not the same I'm gonna be completely honest with you man. Hell. No, I was right You were looking for it was right back out there man, I got shot I probably went out there the next day or the day after that with a boot on my leg Just outside standing looking for hope of a cut back in it. No, not even that It was just like not caring like really just not caring if they come back for real Like cuz we I mean it's not like we was oblivious to it Like we knew possibly like yeah, they gonna come back through this bitch. It's a war zone It's hot if I'm saying come through this bitch shooting at any day, but I wasn't worried about I wasn't scared if I'm saying like and like I said Right before I got shot. I did have a gun on me I'm through it if I'm saying when the police came so it's like you and I was back out there the next day I was back out there with a boot can't run but got guns on me still like but ain't nobody lose their life Doing that. No, not that day. Nope. No, they just got people just got here Yeah, nobody lost a life for sure But none of us like got shot that day for sure shit made the news and everything like damn I mean it was in the car for five what in the car they came they rolled through But they came spreading they get that lady was came hot Was came hot damn man, I just You told a story like you know what you like you realize that you know what I'm not the same guy anymore and Me not being the same guy anymore I can't people people that I love in harm's way mom you ain't driving me to school no more You know, I'm not dropping you off to school the home is that this is what we this is who we are, right? We good with it. Whatever happened to us. I can live with that But if something would have happened to my mom or sister, I'm really gonna go crazy. So she's gonna really I'm Never gonna eat. Yeah, cuz if you get my mom or my sister, it's never gonna be so I'm not even I don't got none to live For sure so it's like yeah, I understood that early like I never put my mom in a car my aunties Grandmother nobody ever got in the car with me And I never got in the car with them like I would rather just wait all day until somebody picked me up before I desperately Tell my mama to drop me off somewhere if it were and I didn't did that many as many of times, you know, and The first thing I did when I got some real money The very first thing I did was bought my mama a house far far far away Right super far like I mean my mama like 40 minutes away from the hood You know and nobody never knew where she lived Only probably three of my closest friends ever been to my mama house still to this day You feel me? So I always been one of the kind of people just like, you know protect family My dad taught me that like I come from a two-parent household So my pops always told me like to protect your family no matter what you got going on my parents always like Trusted me enough to just make good decisions Like although I was in the streets and I had like shit going on They trusted me to never bring it back to my right if I'm saying and like I took that real serious You mentioned that you were in the street you come from a two-parent household Your dad your mom ever say son son, you don't have to do that. Um, I think I was just too far You weren't trying to hear that I was to I was too far going I'm not gonna lie and I always been like real strong-headed like and my dad he know me like me and him the same sign And everything so it's like once I was already in it All they could really do is tell me just be smart for me. Like it was I was too too late You went to high school with king bond. Yeah. Yeah. Yep bond probably was in a One or two is that same come back? Yeah, for sure, yeah, I definitely went to high school with bondo Well, so what so what so what was it? So, I mean obviously you say you went to school not not not very long But when you what was your what was your thoughts when you first met him? actually I had already known like who vaughn was right for school because you got like mutual friends Okay, my homie, like I said one of my best friends what he from the projects that got knocked down And a lot of those people from like vaughn hood like oblock and shit like that. They from those projects Okay, so like they had already like known each other and we didn't been around each other many a time So it's like already like vaughn and knew like and knew like what he was about like bro was the real deal for real Oh, he's on that type of time for me now for sure So like is that true? That'd be same. Hey, they said I mean I'll be reading I don't know if it's true or not But i'll be hearing they like man if you wouldn't do it vaughn like f it i'll go do it myself I mean, yeah, it was a lot of people like that in chicago though for real. Hell. Yeah It was a lot of people but you gotta think about it when you When you own that type of time you can't really like and this is something that's really true I feel like if you second guessing yourself and you can pull me up some more too If you second guessing yourself and you don't want to do it just don't do it you shouldn't do it, right? I'm saying like and I believe in that like I wouldn't want to have nobody around me for real that I gotta like question the second guess because that could cost you a life for sure for real like somebody to choke up and freeze and Oh, that's what cost your life Yeah So it's like yeah for sure if he wasn't on that type of time he didn't want to hang with you I wouldn't want to hang with you either because it's like you really don't want to do this go find you something else to do This ain't this ain't for you. You know i'm saying so it's like yeah for sure for sure I'm like that was probably the first day of school when I seen vaughn in there He walked up to my homie like hey boy It's going down in this like if i'm saying like he already want us like boy. Y'all be on point here. Damn Yeah for sure How difficult was it for you to watch Him getting murdered on video that shit broke my heart for sure like I don't like I don't really be Like Emotional for real like i'm so numb to death I'm not a stranger to it because i've been experiencing it my whole life but like when he when he died and seeing that shit like That shit really like you know, I'm getting emotional right now thinking about it Did you hear about it and then watch the video or did you see the video first because did you get I had no I had heard about it already. I heard about it the night it happened Okay, i'm saying because we got so many mutual friends and shit got right to me You feel me like as soon as it happened. I knew probably like an hour later You feel me right and then I seen the video and yeah, that shit definitely made me emotional for sure like just seeing it and no matter like And I don't want people to like take what i'm saying And Misconfuse it like when we come from Sometimes you just you just well not sometimes a lot of times you got to adapt to your environment like no matter what you might think somebody did or Some shit a nigga might did like we really be having good hearts at the end of the day Like I don't care what Von did in the streets. That was a good nigga like a real nigga. You feel I'm saying it's like Don't give me I believe in like Universal law you feel i'm saying so it's like have it played out and play it out Okay, you feel me you live out of gun you die by the gun You know i'm saying like a real a real that come from the streets understand understand that understand it 100 But just seeing it like you know i'm saying just seeing like damn like that shit. I feel like that wasn't His story like you know i'm saying I feel like it just he had so much more life so much more shit to do like You feel me like I took Von on his first tour like as a as a main artist like he He performed they're not performing. You feel me? So it's like I always fuck with bro. I always believe them You feel me like when that shit happened to just like it threw me out It just it just made me feel like like damn bro. You can't take this shit for granted like this shit Let me understand bro Your whole life you thinking and i'm sure he thought the very same thing I want to get out of this environment He's out. He's a big rapper Why go back Why do that? Why continue to do that? I feel like i'm not even gonna feel like like this is the truth is just like When that shit in you is in you like that shit Just it's easy for like you gotta really you gotta work harder on not doing something to somebody Than than anything else you feel me saying so it's like I think you feel like when you know what you're capable of you feel like somebody playing with you You would just do something like you would just make you how you let them play with you You're not even supposed to be in that environment guess what yeah, I make four five million dollars a year Aren't you gonna surround yourself because you don't need to be in that environment anymore because those that those guys are no longer on your level Now you hang around with people that's on your level you hang with me you hang with future You hang with thug you hang with those type of people. Yeah, bro I ain't on this no more. It's like you gotta it take a little minute to adjust though It's not like a snap of a finger. Okay, vine wasn't he wasn't a millionaire for years, right? I'm saying like he still was fresh. He's still trying to stack coming out the streets. I'm saying like he getting his money he doing what he doing but It take you a long time to really process that this is my life, right? You feel i'm saying so it's like naturally he really step a street nigger So he gonna react like how a street react you feel me like it took me years and years to just be like shit ain't worth it Like you know i'm saying like i'm about to give a scenario I was just saying North carolina rallies some dumbass shit niggas walked up on me and like tried me in the mall like saying some shit to me Like yeah I'm not even gonna like say the artist or whatever. He walked up to me tomorrow another artist like yeah um We got this chain telling bad back like and i'm like the fuck you mean I don't care about that shit I'm like what the fuck you telling me for that's exactly what I said to him. He like yeah um I'm just saying like if he want to get it tell him get up with us. I said bro I'm sure they know how to find y'all and get that shit back if they want it And i'm walking off and he said some shit like yeah Because nigga we was just just just telling you like bro. You a little too aggressive like we would take your shit I ain't had no jury on or nothing. I just looked back And walked off like it's that's one of the but you were like that's one of the hardest things to do to walk away for real Like you know i'm saying like I had to grow into that person Like I know for a fact I got 10 shopping bags in my hand like I dropped these shopping bags And we are just ten this whole fucking mall up I'll really do that with y'all right two of y'all and it's two of me and my homie You know what i'm saying and I had to tell him like come on we going bro. It ain't really worth it Right i'm not finna I don't have no point to prove for real like you got to really get me out of my element or Put your hands on me and cause some physical harm And I know that y'all really not on that type of time because I just turned my back on y'all and walked off So if y'all really wanted to do something y'all hit if y'all really want to do something y'all would even do it on top Exactly, but it's like when I turned around I never looked back really I never looked back to see if they followed me or nothing. I really made them part of my whole back And it's like that shit is that's growth Like I never was that person like because you never give up your six. I was never that person for real Like i'm not finna turn around on y'all I'm not finna just walk off after you just said you would take my shit out of me like take what? What you talking about what you want to do in here right now? I already cared not cared about my clothes that I just bought none of this shit. You found me saying like I had to grow into that person. It took years to do that. You feel what i'm saying? I'll let the say von hadn't became that person yet to just like let shit go right sweep it under the rug Like he couldn't let that yeah, like whatever whatever was on his mind was on his mind Well, he just felt like all right, but i'm finna just go do what I gotta do Knowing that if you live like that You gotta always always Have both eyes not one eye both eyes three eyes Are you surprised that hit somebody they were able to get the drop on him like they did? No, i'm not because that's that's just how shit happened. You know what i'm saying? It happened like that in the blink of an eye Like super quick. I didn't seen that happen a hundred times. Not just to him So no, I wasn't I wasn't surprised at all. I was Just really just heartbroken bad for real because like once it once shit happened It's nothing you could do regardless of how your homies react or whatever. What's done is done to him is already Yeah, ain't no coming back exactly. So it's like when when you understand that like I didn't seen it so many times so it's like I know and this is just my mentality though to be honest like I always feel like something is going to happen to me Anyway, when I walk out the house, i'm already in fear. I'm already Why don't I don't put it i'm not putting it in the in the air Like I don't feel like somebody gonna do something to me, but I just know The possibilities like it can happen. So that's what keep me on my square Right i'm saying like i'm not gonna get into a fist fight at a club I'm not gonna get into a fist fight at the mall I'm not going because I gotta get home to my kids. So it's like i'm already gonna go to the highest level Like that's what I mean by like i'm already feeling like something Is gonna happen to me i'm afraid that's what i'm saying like it's okay to be afraid I think being scary is going to get you home every time you feel i'm saying like I don't care about that. Like I tell me yeah, i'm scared because i'm gonna react like i'm scared. You feel i'm saying Do you feel even though you've been you're like bro? I done moved away from that. That ain't that ain't even about that Ain't not it's in me I just want you to know it's in me. Yeah, but I don't want him to come out I ain't even on that type of time To at all but you got it and this is the real part about it though for real like um I feel like when you become that person they just pull at you like yeah, especially people who from where you're from They know how to get it out. They know how to get it out you and it's like it's a full-time job to like Not react and not crash out like let people say stuff lets people say certain things because i'm always always been a kind of guy like I Really go show love like when i'm back home. I do events I do stuff for the kids for the community You feel i'm saying I go out I enjoy myself all my homies who want to come out We can go to the club and do all that kind of stuff So I don't respond to negativity because it's like i'm outside too much right and you will see me I don't want to bring that type of energy on myself. You feel i'm saying so it's like once you see it You will see stuff. It might make you upset you see it stuff on the internet You want to look at the comments and all that shit But you can't really let it affect you because you putting it on you Like you putting too much of that energy on you or people would just try to try you and just make a name for They so for real i've seen it so many times. Yes, where it's like Yeah, you could change the elevator and say I don't want to be that person no more But you gotta stay sharp you have to like because in the instant in the instant it'll happen So it's like you kind of know you gee they know you bro. That ain't on him. That's in him. Yeah, he really liked that Yeah, and so you like go go to our your weight You got people who will really like know that and crash because they don't got nothing to live for right? They like they don't really even damn they care about their life that much Yeah, if he don't give a damn about he is he gonna listen to me like he won't need to do something to him Damn that just so it's like I could my life up. I could go to jail or possibly die anything like people really want you to Stoop down to their level a lot like especially coming from chicago, you know what I'm saying? Like I see it a lot. I've seen it so many times and what I'm saying about like staying sharp is like you don't have to Become the aggressor in a situation But you got to create boundaries like as soon as somebody cross that line, you got to take it there That's the only way that it's going to really like resolve in my opinion, right? Somebody cross that line say certain shit like my mama always told me somebody tell you they crazy believe him So it's like if somebody say something to me, I'm automatically on radar and i'm ready to like Take it to the highest level because it's like why are you even trying me? I gotta I gotta make it home So we not finna it's not finna be no in between either choice between who goes on I'm not taking it. Yeah, if you want to take it down We're gonna take it all the way there man, or we just not gonna take it there at all If I'm saying geez, I mean, I mean we usually like he crazy like play play crazy or get a check crazy You know, they're two different things now for sure. No for sure. That's definitely like there's two different can two different can like and a lot of people Get a check crazy A lot of people really like you know saying like and and I seen I know it like in chicago It's like that place is different like right anybody the craziest looking person You will never think or really do something to you. It's like you gotta just stay on your Doesn't that get tired? Yeah. Hell yeah. I mean, I mean, I mean because you um what's the movie uh bumpy jones and with uh, uh with whispers and um You know what? Yeah, and he's like he doesn't i'm tired. Yes. I'm tired. Yeah, that's one of my favorite movies ever. I'm like, bro I mean to like Have you ever had a peaceful night's sleep? Can you rest can you just lay down and like Go get in a rim sleep. You know, the only time I really sleep like that is when i'm home with my girl and my kids Like for real even on the road like I still have nightmares a lot bro, like nightmares like sleep paralysis Like it'd be hard for me like my girl be waking me up. Sometimes she like man. What's wrong with you? Like y'all you crying in your sleep you jumping like yeah, you hear me like all of that kind of stuff and I hate it though. I'm not gonna lie. I don't like it at all. You feel i'm saying and I didn't try it all If you know, I've got a real non-profit where I get therapy to all types of kids. I didn't try therapy myself I'm still you know, believe in therapy and try to have sessions as much as I can. You know what i'm saying? But it's like It don't really help for real for real, especially with like sleep and stuff like that Like I got bad insomnia. I'd be up all night all night and I might get a couple hours of sleep and I feel like though In my opinion the only way is going to kind of like change I'm gonna have to really retire and not deal with people and not deal with the shit that I deal with That's a long time so like I probably don't get no good night of sleep until i'm 50 years old 50 55 years old Don't worry about it. Your bladder get bad and you don't get no good night's sleep Trust me You had a friend that uh, reportedly was killed Um, I think he was shot at a barbershop Mm-hmm. Yeah That's who I was like that was my best friend, but I called him my little brother who that's what was mad at me about the show Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah Obviously you say that was your best friend you called him, you know, like your little brother. Yeah when you got that news What what some of the emotions you started to feel um, honestly that was Probably one of the worst days of my life for sure like I never felt that like shocked and hurt and disappointment like when it happened and You know, it's so crazy. He probably He might have got killed 11 a.m Chicago time so that's like 9 a.m in l.a.

I don't even care like i'm gonna just be honest like when I when I went to Chicago I went like on time and like I took a hoodie I have I had packed all type of crazy shit I was planning to go to Chicago and just like and I was ready to throw my life away You don't live there with the homie you live. I was ready to throw my life away for real. I drove my trackhawk To One of my my man's crib in la who I like was in business with and just talking to him And I had the suitcase in the back of my trackhawk And he's upstairs talking He like man You need a drink Gave me a drink. I took it and i'm like a real like I don't believe in coincidence. Like i'm a real spiritual person Um It's when i'm on my head i'm like bro I can't believe i'm trying to go back to Chicago. That's when I know he was dead That's when I felt like he was dead already. I'm like bro i'm trying to go back to Chicago this shit like I really was ready to like just throw my life away. I really didn't give a for real when that shit happened I looked out the window. I seen like 200 birds flying Like just right out the window like it's a flock of birds so many birds. I'm like Damn man a little bro with us go to heaven like you feel like in my head i'm like Okay, man I ain't even finna go back and crash out like me seeing them birds go up in the right It just like it kind of calmed me down. It gave you a sense of peace Yeah in a way like for real even the first like literally The very first when it happened. I ain't even got on the plane yet. I'm still like I took like three shots a hennessey And i'm still in my head i'm still angry of course, but i'm like damn i'm looking at these birds when i'm thinking about this shit like Damn, man, you know, it just my head up like I ain't finna crash out but I get on the plane still And I left The whole suitcase is how you know my mind racing. I left the whole suitcase in my truck I got in a black truck to the airport. I didn't even grab a suitcase out of my bag. I mean out of my car And I get on the plane I go to sleep and I swear to god I had a dream that me him And his baby his second baby mama. He got to two bay mama me him and his second baby mama Was just walking around the neighborhood going door to door like asking who killed him and he with me Like me him and his baby mama just asking like yeah who killed bro, but he right there with me asking who killed him You know what i'm saying? It's like I don't know that shit my head up. I got off the plane like damn i just had this crazy ass dream like I go straight to his grandma house and see her start crying hugging and shit i'm just like man You ain't like you ain't got to worry about nothing like you feel i'm saying like yeah, he gone but you got me I promise i'm always be there like, you know what i'm saying? I'm gonna be there for his kids like I took on that role and responsibility like no matter what How big how much my career is hectic like i'm gonna always be there for his family You know what i'm saying? It's like I can't do that if I crash out so it's like I just took on that responsibility of Being the closest thing to him, you know for his family and And I i'm grateful for that I appreciate that when I hear that because that was somebody that I love unconditionally and I know his family loved me and it's like I feel like they when they tell me that like man Like you're the closest thing we have to him like we need you like these kids need you You know what i'm saying? So it's like I just took on that role and of course a part of me is Gone forever and I feel like No matter what I do or how much success I get I never really could enjoy it for real because I always picture him Because the person you wanted to share it with is Being here you feel what i'm saying like I was thinking about when I get 30 and 40 if I ever win a grammy just certain shit is like it's not going to really feel right because I wanted to enjoy it with him and I always get them little thoughts and flashbacks in my head and stuff like that But it turned me into a different person man. I fell into alcoholism crazy I was down in a whole fifth a day like by myself literally Every single day like i'm glad you pulled out of that. Yeah, I was stretched out I turned into a totally different person like and I just had I just had my second son like I turned into like Man, it was um, I was just like a different person like I really felt like I couldn't Be a father like the way I wanted to be like I was so stretched out and so depressed was like I didn't want to be home because I didn't want my girl to see me that week Like I was at my weakest and my lowest so I used to have to be outside and Ride around and go cry go to clubs and just do stupid ass shit just to get my mind off of What was what I was really thinking about for real? But I definitely pulled out of it and one of the conversations that helped me was a conversation with his grandma And she told me the real she told me the ugly that I really didn't want to hear She like she really looked at me and said yeah My grandson died because of you everybody really know that he Got killed because somebody wanted to hurt me like oh, yeah, this hurt her best friend like gonna do something to him, right? You feel me and When she told me that she like because she's seeing me Just slipping through the cracks getting drunk here that she like you better not your life Like all we got is you like you better make something in your life I know how much he loves you believe in you like I don't okay We hurting you all hurt but it's like you're not gonna let him die for nothing You better be the best you could be and that shit really like maybe snap out of it. Yeah Savage 21 savage he did a tribute. I know you're very you're good friends with savage. What did that mean to you? man just I ain't gonna lie savage one of the realest niggas I ever met in life for real like he's so solid bro, and it's because like My friends my brothers became his brothers and vice versa right i'm saying like when he lost like people that he lost like when he lost Skinny and cj. NM. You feel i'm saying like that shit, you know, it made me feel I sat down with him You guys personality y'all y'all I can see how y'all guys became friends. Yeah now for sure. Yeah, we both livers too Okay. Yeah, that's my brother like like How we locked in like i'm seeing how he really take care of people Yes, and he cared about his brothers. You know i'm saying like I do the same thing right and he was seeing it. So it's like when i'm coming to Atlanta I'm really only going around him. I'm hanging around him and his homies like sometimes he not even coming outside I'm with his man's name I'm saying so it's like they really became my brothers and vice versa the same way like he come to chicago Like he was just in chicago. He was in my hood with my homies. I wasn't there Right, like we really got that type of love and mutual respect for each other. You feel me? It's like When when he saw what that did to me like one little bro It's like that shit really hurt him too. He called me about it like man, whatever you need like anytime any situation happen with somebody With me or anything like he called like whatever you need call me You know i'm saying it's like I still i'm not gonna hit him for sure That's my brother, you know, but it's like I know for a fact he he there for me and in any situation He gonna be there. You feel i'm saying like I talked to bro down there every day, right? When chief keith uh moved to la was that when you felt that you needed to make the move to me? Yeah, I ain't gonna lie. That was goaded I talk about that so much bro, like When sosa moved to la it just It made it possible for us like damn you could just go to cali and ain't gotta look over your shoulder no more That was the coldest shit ever to me like I didn't even really like and that's crazy We were just so like young and dumb and naive to how much Life is outside of chicago, right? I'm saying we like damn social just moved to la and got a big ass mansion like I couldn't wait to do that shit As soon as I what uncle aroi say when I got that check I was gone I changed as soon as I got a chance to move to la I was up right i'm like damn bro Sosa just started a whole new life here. Like he don't even gotta like Think about this shit. No more You don't gotta look over your shoulders none of that like when we moved to la It's not even like how la was for real Like I mean how la is now like I feel like covet kind of la up where it's like Yeah, link is getting robbed and certain. Yeah, that's sure that shit wasn't going on like that when we first came here Like i've been in la for like seven years. Okay, sosa been here like 10 11 some shit like that. You feel me? So like when he when he first moved to la like I was like damn I can't wait Like when he made that move it was like and sosa always been the blueprint for like like certain niggas might not say it but like i'ma always give bro his flouts like he really the Greatest thing that happened to Chicago in my opinion like would you have ever left chicago had he not moved to la no Hell no, I wouldn't even know what to do I wouldn't have knew that like they could just leave and go like you feel like I would have had to see it like To see it to believe it. You know what i'm saying? Like he moved to la. I'm like damn that shit hard You feel i'm saying like and as soon as I got a chance to I did it You feel i'm saying like just the best thing you've done hell. Yeah, and like I feel like it saved my life for real for real for real like moving to la 100 saved my life You know what i'm saying? And like when sosa got all that money sosa was 16 with real millions of dollars You know what i'm saying? Like I was 16 with some money. I had a couple hundred thousand Millions of dollars at 16 years old. Right. So it's like his life was different, you know, like he had The big mansions the cars like he was really like the inspiration for us and my homie who I was saying cap Like my homie marvin who I was saying was like cocky on the block where he told us not to move right? That was one of sosa's best friends. They grew up together. They from the same project So that's how I knew sosa like when I first started rapping was around the time He started rapping and we really like was homies You know what i'm saying? Like sosa is somebody who I really consider my brother And it's somebody that's still like even though we're the same age he always inspired me You know what i'm saying? Like motivating me like all right, but so that was your first interaction with him because One of your partners was his partner. That's how y'all met y'all interactions was in the studio together Okay, okay. Like we like 15 years old. I'm saying I started he had his own basically kind of like his own studio in his hood with uh with like his homies and his engineer and we just came in and like Paid for studio time there you feel me because my homie like cap and walk who brothers who grew up with sosa they like Referred us like man y'all should go record right there Just pay for the studio time and we would come like sosa be recording when he of course he was always the first priority So it's like when he done recording then we get studio time. So like that's how we really met um You said nicky minaj was really the first one to give you an opportunity. She wanted a feature Yeah, but when she called you you ain't answer the phone. No, I ain't believe it I didn't so she called it. She called your phone. You're like you're like she said what she said. No, she was so look She didn't the original call. It wasn't her on the phone. Okay, if i'm saying it was uh safari number on the phone Okay, call So when they hit us it was like four in the morning. I'm in the studio I'm half lean and pills and all type of bullshit Okay They like yeah, man nicky them trying to get you to come to atlanta do no verse i'm doing verse like this Nicky them team on the phone. You like you want to talk to him? Like man hell no, you know nicky them bro, like man go on with this shit Like that's why I told my manager like bro, he like you want to talk to him on the phone I'm like man, no, I know that's not them like man you tweaking you just because at the at that point We hot so people calling playing on the phone all the time. So it's like oh man, that ain't them bro They call back like two three years later. I mean not two three years two Days later like what the fuck y'all doing? Like we trying to put y'all on the plane at la to come through the song So then I wind up talking to him on the phone for real like I bet now they serious And I got on the plane and I did the verse And she was just telling me like like how she fucked with my music and like she wanted to do the song The beat that she had she wanted to do the song like with my cadence You know what i'm saying? Like that's why like i'm gonna always fuck with nicky and respect nicky Because she was like i'm trying to use your cadence and your flow And I ain't want to feel like I was like biting biting your flow or swagger jacket Even though she a female and i'm a male like you don't really matter. She's right. I ain't want to feel like I was using your flow and not Show love and put you on the record and at that point that that time like I wasn't really like A real like I felt I could rap but I wasn't like a real mc Where I would have called it like if she would have put that song out without hitting me I wouldn't have been like, oh she stole my flow on this shit. I wouldn't even notice Because it's nicky manaz. I wouldn't even thought about it. Damn. She used the same pockets that I'd be in. I didn't know that much about Lyrics and pockets and shit like I used to just go and rap like everybody used to say I rapped off beat when I first Started rapping because I would just go like, you know, I has one bar two bar three bar four bars and it's a different Pocket or cadence on the beat that classifies was one to four bars, right? I wouldn't start on the one sometimes I start on the two sometimes I'll start on the three And just rap so people would say I was off beat technically I was but I was fitting a whole bar into that like a whole sentence into it where it still made sense. So it's like Some people hated me for it. Some people loved me for it. You know what I'm saying? So it's like I never would have noticed anything you feel me, but right she pulled me out there And I did the verse with her in the studio. She had me in the studio with me I mean with her and I spent like a whole day with her Yeah, we was just chilling and talking and she liked that and the studio was big as shit So I first I started like recording part of my verse in the booth and she like I I want to do something real quick I'm trying to do like she told me she was finna do something like for her verse and work on another song So she like like it's another studio another booth over. I've never seen no shit like that She like yeah, you can record on the other side. I'm like damn. It's the other side I couldn't believe this shit Like that shit that's really inspiring like what's a lot of money out here? You gotta go get this shit, you know what I'm saying? Like and after I did I went home And just turned me into like a monster like I mean after I did that video I probably made like a half a million dollars just grinding just like i'm going to do shows i'm doing shit I was youngest here like i'm probably like 16 17 17 years old. I wasn't no longer no older than 18 Hell yeah, I made a lot of money after I did this song and I was like I really credited to her because she just Made like well, I got a song with Nicki Minaj.

This shit was huge coming there We auditioned for the for well, he like helped me with the with the with the lines he helped me read and it's like it gave me a different kind of respect for him just because He gave me that opportunity to do it and two I wasn't like I wasn't ready to be an actor yet I didn't have it in me at that moment and he was so like it went from I yeah This common big bro to know i'm acting and you acting like just like the look like in it like because the script i'm reading I'm having to talk to like a gangster. You're saying it's like His whole everything his whole demeanor change whole demeanor change was like he really transformed And i'm in my head like what the fuck can he do that? It was crazy to me bro. And it's like it made me uncomfortable because i'm like All right, bro snap back real quick So we get back talking like we're working. Yeah. Yeah, you feel i'm saying it's like But he helped me I did the I did it I put it in And I I didn't get the role though I didn't get the role because I just I couldn't lock in into that like I couldn't but I just i'm gonna always fuck a bro because he really he told me like man come here i'm gonna help you with this shit Right, what's some of the best advice carmen gave you because obviously he's in the rap game But you know, he's kind of he does more in the tv and the film industry now But what are some of the advice that he passed along to you that day that exact day told me like bro You gotta always like like gather information like Read on stuff like you know i'm saying before you make a decision like Read learn about it. You know what i'm saying? Like that's what he told me that and it was like it didn't have nothing to do with acting Right. He talking about like music. You know what i'm saying being an artist like he like read articles about like label shit, you know what i'm saying like read articles about The Touring like shit like that like read articles about the touring business, you know what i'm saying like Read the dictionary like shit like that. He like well if you really want to be a lyricist and he said that because He had put me on His album right before that and that shit got nominated for a grammy too He put me on his album and the project the the beat that we did was produced by no id and he was just like bro like You young but like you a real mc like a spitter. He like the more knowledge you get is just gonna make you Better as an artist like better as a rapper and I listened though. I ain't gonna lie like I really like I read a lot of shit now like I ain't gonna lie I read a lot of shit and I be reading like I read a dictionary Trying to learn new words like from that point on and my homies knew like seeing my homie man He had contest to it like he like bro No, I'd be reading a dictionary all type of shit Like I go to google and just try to learn new words right before I start rapping And I feel like that make it like it just elevate where it's like you're not rapping about the same shit You feel i'm saying it can't nobody really teach you that but an mc like a real mc for real You know i'm saying so yeah shout out to big bro, man. I got a lot of love for cover for sure you did A song You did a song with Kanye, but I don't think it came out How many times can you make Kanye is known for making guys redo their verse? Yeah over and over and over Rosé tell the story that he had a had him do a verse he didn't say what you mean Rosal a hard He but he said hey Ross. I know you go harder than that. Yeah, he did that to me for sure He made me redo my verse about three times for sure on that one record I think I did two records for Kanye that didn't come out great I pulled up on him in the studio and I seen like so basically like How he record or work on certain projects like it's just live mics had all us in here right now Everybody just doing cadences rapping singing shit is live mic So there's so much going on that shit kind of like got confusing right you feel me I'm like, I ain't never seen it before he freestyled and he asked me like All right hit something say four bars eight bars and i'm like, all right, I'll try but I don't even know Like what we've basically rapping on it's an acapella all type of shit so I ended up Getting the song he like man i'ma just sing it And I want you to record your verse to it. So I recorded my verse in like new york sent it back Told me to redo it again like change so much stuff and I sent it the final verse that I sent though was like Superfied like hard hard hard. I wish I could really like Call him and just get the shit like oh, you don't even got to be on it Give me my verse and i'ma redo that shit and put it out right now You know what i'm saying? Like that's one of the hardest verses I feel like I spit for sure though Okay, one thing I learned in this in this business though, like When you do stuff and it might not work out or come out like you can't really take it personal Right. I didn't like fault Kanye and nothing like that. I feel like damn I did all this shit And he ain't put the song out like I didn't really care I was just really grateful for the opportunity and grateful to like be able to get in the studio with him and just Would you say rappers do get upset if they get on the track and they know the guy don't they don't a lot of rappers Get upset about that. Hell. Yeah Rappers getting rap beefs about that. Really? Yeah. Hell yeah niggas get mad about that shit for sure Like when you don't put them on a project or they pull up on you and do shit, but it's all art It's all creativity and a lot of times For a lot of artists it'd be out of their hands Like I wouldn't say that for me because I've always picked my songs for every project, you know what I'm saying or Majority of them and then I'm I believe in like Constructive criticism. So my team around me might be like no, this is better song This to hit this radio and I don't really I never really focused on like radio records and stuff early on in my career So they will have that input but I would really do the body of work for real. So But other artists who write who they team pick the whole Mixtape or album and like they have no input or they don't you know, I'm saying so like that happened a lot You know a lot of times people just don't make the cut and artists to get mad like they'll start with you for real I've never been that artist though. Like I always just never took a person like I is cool I ain't really tripping like my first interaction with Kanye is he talked walked up to me like man, you gotta like You gotta start like tripping with these niggas You gotta start dissing these niggas stop letting them steal your style and steal your flow and I'm out here and I'm like Damn, I don't even know you really listen to me enough for like you to say right? And he's taking my flow like what my flow is and then you're hearing somebody else record Be like, oh he using her bowl flow he using this shit and that was the first thing he ever said to me You know what I'm saying? It's like that just made me like kind of like oh, yeah, I fuck with you I'm saying that that was way before I did the records with him or any of this shit You know what I'm saying? So when it didn't make it though, I was really just mad that I don't have a verse to use because I don't you have to put a verse back No, I didn't I need to i'm asking you right now. Yeah, he sent me Send me the verse and i'm gonna put that shit out for sure like just my verse because it was fire I was talking about like chicago shit like just a lot of shit that was like near and dear to me Right. Yeah, you mentioned that you want to rap on uh, uh his song uh through the wire You want to rap over that? I wind up I actually wind it up. Um Doing it. I did it for my my project. Um Greatest rapper alive, but I was always scared of that sample though like because it's just like That's one of the hardest songs ever to me in general You know what i'm saying? And then me being from chicago And it being yay being that simple like some things you just don't want to run up on because the internet gonna troll you Oh, yeah, right you man. Hey, hey herbal You know what's coming if you don't do it right man, he could left that alone Yeah, so certain ones I don't really run up on but at that time I had a lot of like Pain in me like built up emotion. My pops had just died I was talking about like, you know, I felt like I didn't I couldn't rap on that unless I had something That was like super like pain driven like how he did right from him getting into that Card, wreck almost losing his life right he wrapped about almost losing his life If i'm saying right like I came from a perspective of me rapping about The stuff that i'm enduring at this moment and being successful and I'm gonna let it they with it. Yeah, the fans definitely with it Well, i'm gonna put you on the spot. Give me your four best Mount rushmore chicago rappers Uh I ain't gonna crew myself though. Okay um I'm gonna do sosa I Juice world yay And i'm gonna do Smirk and I could I could like explain I didn't really include myself because I already like including myself Right like that even though I do feel like i'm on a lot of people's mount rushmore You know what i'm saying, but i'm just talking about me personally like and that gotta do with like Influence and what you did right for the music and like the music industry coming out of chicago So it's like gotta go juice real because he just he did something phenomenal that nobody really ever did for real and then sosa because Just like the impact that he had on on us in chicago in the world and so young doing it like sosa Still one of my favorite artists still regardless if i'm saying then yay That's undeniable. Yeah And then smirk is just What I admire the most about dirk is He always been like Me watching from the very beginning. He always been somebody that like Through all adversity or any trials or tribulations. He always been able to like overcome that shit and reinvent himself like i've seen him reinvent himself so many times and just Become one of the biggest artists in the world. You feel me like that's one thing like That I admire the most about dirk like outside of his talent You know what i'm saying? That's what really make him the goat to me because when you come from Where we come from and been through the stuff that we've been through is like it's easy to give up It's easy to be like man i'm finna just keep trying like he is switch it all the way up And master that again if that don't work switch it up master that switch it and just keep elevating You feel me like that's like a superpower to me, right? You compare juice world death to two pocket bacon for your generation. Why? because all of the Lives that he Influenced while he was here. You feel i'm saying like he was somebody that he was like a real global superstar mogul for like the The kids that were like misunderstood and the loss and the hopeless and stuff like that like you feel i'm saying he gave people like Reason to want to live like people who contemplated suicide and stuff like that those were the people that his music touched and When his life was cut so short It devastated so many people. You know i'm saying it devastated A generation of kids if i'm saying the same way Being a two pocket devastated a generation of people You know i'm saying like I wasn't trying to like and people kind of like took that the wrong way Yeah, I wasn't trying to say like he was as big as big as two pocket like if i'm saying right He done as much as being in two part I'm talking about the the effect that it had on a whole generation of people where it's like his music up forever live on and when people die like Posthumous music posthumous it always like go up it become big but like his is To 10 years 20 years 30 years from now like it's still gonna be here. You feel i'm saying That's what I meant by that like because the people Who loved him so much If they was 10 years old or whatever when they turned 40 years old those songs gonna still touch them Yeah, the exact same way that it did because they gonna remember his legacy like that's what I meant by that When you got the word that he had tragically passed away from an accident on the over hill. Yeah um I was in la at the time And I think my girl called my girl called me first and told me um And I got mad at her like man, what's what's like what you talking about? She like juice rose just passed away. I'm like man, he tripping and just hung up like when like i'll be in disbelief when i'm Writing that type of shit. I don't it just it it Threw me because it's hard when people that you know people that you know They're not supposed to die at 20th into 20th and then at 30th. That's not supposed to happen We're supposed to be like 75 80 years old well such-as-such had a heart attack and such-as-such that you don't expect somebody He was so like he had reached like the height of like so much success. Yeah, I'm saying and I feel like he was just reaching his peak like it was his birthday I think he died six days after his birthday or something like that. You feel me? It's like that was my little brother. So it really like it messed me up mentally. You feel me? He died on December 8th, I believe And We're supposed to shot a video on 11th So I was on my way to him like for the me him in chicago and it's just like that shit just threw me all the way off when I got the information and like just him being like Just he like he was just like a good ass kid bro, like for real like even the way he died like You rich as f**k juice like you rich as a f**k You get pulled over by the police you swallow 50 pills 40 pills How the f**k many pills he swallowed because he's scared like you was gonna overcome that shit We're gonna look pills. They ain't give a f**k about that shit bro. I threw that shit I want to hear that shit sitting on a counter like dang Come get it for real like bro. I got 50 million. I ain't finna go to jail for these little dumb ass pills right here like you feel me like it just lets you know like how Pure he was like you feel I'm saying he didn't know no better like you know, I'm saying, you know the term like God forgive fools and babies like that type like he was just like super naive to the shit You found me saying like that's what me up the most because it's like bro. You ain't even have to do that Right. That shit wasn't about nothing You've told a story a few times about How you had a substance abuse problem you mentioned I think early in the interview that you was 15 you started taking pills and you started, you know smoking weed, you know, obviously, you know You talked about how you graduated lean and so you went to Twice. Yeah How difficult is it? To come to the realization. I got a damn problem, man. Yeah When it become like part of your lifestyle for real like so you couldn't function without it I couldn't function without it. Like I had to drink lean every day. I had to pop pills I had to do this shit to eat food to like I I say a lot of times like I used to really be in rooms and I wasn't there because mentally my brain is somewhere else Um how i'm thinking about shit i'm grieving like just thinking about trauma where it's like I'm just maneuvering through the room. I might say what's up introduce myself But it might be somebody that I probably should have had a conversation with right but I couldn't do it because My man is somewhere else because i'm altering my brain with these drugs I'm thinking I need this shit to function but it's really like you masking something It's making a mask and something you feeling like I can't even be in the moment because um, what's that saying like When you live in the past is Grief and we live in the future is anxiety. I'm never in the moment Like i'm thinking about before I get in this room What's gonna happen? Yeah, that's gonna play out. You feel me instead of just enjoying the moment And I became that person for like so many years. You feel me like I used to have to like Take zans and perks and shit just to go to sleep. Like I said, like I still right now to this day I have insomnia. I don't sleep. I've been like that since a kid since 15 years old. You feel me like and I used to drink A lot of it. It don't make it no better when you got money, right? Yeah, because you got access to it. Yeah access to it. You feel i'm saying so it's like i'm going through pints and pints of lean and going through To 100 pills a month like damn like that. Yeah for real was bad like a hundred a month I'm popping four five pills a day You feel i'm saying like probably more than that. Did you because you said you started like what 15 was it? Dealing with the trauma that you saw you saw your friends You saw your homies and they're losing their lives and you're trying to mask that because you know kids and i feel it Yes, yeah kids are not supposed to have to deal with that. Yeah, like you don't want to feel it man You got like I was a I was a freshman in high school still you feel i'm saying I started experiencing all this stuff i'm taking these drugs to not feel emotions like As a human being you're supposed to feel emotions. That's the only way you go. That's what makes us human That's the only way you're gonna grow. You feel i'm saying so it's like I was trying to not feel stuff and this was really like When I learned the fact that like all right bet. Yeah, you might Temporarily are you might be high but we wake up the next day That's you don't have to deal with it at some point time It gets worse like you wake up the next day like damn like I was tripping like you know I'm saying you might get into a situation. It's like all right i'm gonna get high I want to think about this right when you wake up sober The it's still there you feel i'm saying that situation if you tried to run from yeah, it's right there. It's still there You know i'm saying and I was just like I didn't I didn't say I was gonna go to rehab You feel i'm saying right people close to me like my closest, you know, i'm saying People that you trusted the most they like bro, you just gotta go like, you know, I had just had a son I just had my first son and they like bro. You just gotta go to rehab like, you know, you're getting too high like You just you lashing out you angry. You feel i'm saying like you ain't listening to nobody like that should make you angry as fuck It make you real angry like and I just I felt like I was losing myself because Because At the time when I first started I was a regular dude, you feel me like I was becoming somebody But now it's like you're 22 years old. You got a son. You're a superstar like you can't just be out here like Like that you feel me because at the end of the day what you think is normal is not people judging you people seeing you outside like He's high all the time It's like, you know, he's why would I want to give you some money? Like why would I want to can I count on you? Can I count on you? Are you reliable? and I was just like, all right, i'm gonna try i'm gonna do it but I went I got sober. It was good and Probably like a year a year and a half later one of my closest friends died And I went right back. I just started back getting high like, you know, that was like my escape the thing you want to You feel i'm saying like damn man, i'm stressed out. I don't want to be around this bit sad crying I'm gonna just get high so i don't feel it, you know, and I started back getting high and for about Probably another year a year and a half and I went again like both times when I had to go to rehab I spent like 30 000 with some shit to go. It was like a Seven eight day process you get out they flush all the everything out your system you On ivy so you don't got to go through the withdrawals. That's another thing like when you drink and lean and popping pills and perks and all that Shit the withdrawal the withdrawal is worse than this worse than anything in the world You don't even want to feel it. You feel i'm saying so it's like that's another thing that people run from like You can't like regardless you're gonna It's gonna come what come what happened in the wash come out in the rinse. Yeah, i'm saying every time you feel me so it's like Uh, you might run from the withdrawals and you might keep on doing this shit for however long and then it's gonna catch up to You when you get older because your body can't take it So it's like it's best to just if anybody you do something crazy when they put you up when they put you in that when they Put you behind that concrete wall. Yeah That's the worst They're doing no drugs to get they have to withdraw i've seen that though like i've seen that with my own eyes like getting arrested And you're seeing like dope fiends and shit on the floor shaking Using the bathroom on itself and all that shit like that shit is real for real You speak very very highly of therapy you say We should do it. Um, trust me as someone that have gone through therapy you say someone has gone through therapy You you need to do that Thug, um, I don't know how well, you know him he said Uh cause some criticism that he would feel less than a man if his girl went to therapy Um, I think what he like I can't really say what slime meant by that like that's my brother, but I feel like Slime one of the people like he had critical thinking too. Yeah, and he wanted people that like Like to dig deep into conversation, right? Like he felt like I think what he meant by that is like He feel like his girl should be able to talk to us and confide in him so much where it's like, you know And I don't know slime ever tried there before you feel me So he probably might not even understand what it might do for a woman or a female There's certain things that a woman just not going to talk to a man about you know what i'm saying Like no matter how much y'all trust each other Because sometimes you want you want someone that doesn't have a dog in the fight exactly she talking You talking bias opinion slimes got a dog in the fight. Yeah. Yeah As someone that's when the therapy and as my therapist and i'll never forget the one of the greatest things she ever told me herbal She said she said I mean she sat across from me just like you my girlfriend was sitting right there She said mr. Sharpe Are you arguing to be right are you arguing for right? What did they do though like what I like She said because at the end right is there Are you arguing to be right or you arguing for right I want to be right Yeah, this is how it was this is how it is. Yeah, I ain't arguing for no right. I want to be right. Yeah. Yeah Once I understood Shannon we can it ain't me versus you. Yeah, it's us versus the problem. It's right versus wrong That's it. She said shannon you you you communicate you speaking She said your girlfriend is speaking mandarin chinese. You speak in spanish Say either you learn to each other's language, but you're never going to be able to communicate That's something really should I ever heard I never heard this argument be right or you argue for right 99.9 percent of the world argued to be right to be right exactly And and so when she explained it like that and I was one of those guys, you know grew up in the south Man, we don't hey, we don't have no emotions and we don't go talk to nobody about problem You could talk to me we could work it out Yeah, but what she's like, but no you got a vested interest in this Somebody needs to hit a problem that doesn't get the benefit from it and so when you share when when You your girl or your wife or whomever share their problem with someone they're just listening Okay, somebody come in and share that problem They're just listening because me i'm gonna hey and that's why you have to keep family out because family they're gonna side with her boat. Yeah You better side with me i'm okay i'm gonna turn the water off now Absolutely, but that but Being all honesty. My sister is the only person that i've ever met that I can tell I would tell us things And she would tell me I was wrong Yeah, you gotta have people like that. She would tell me I like that too though and I was like I'm like like i'm yo, i'm i'm she's like shawty you're wrong. Yeah and it It takes me to a place and it helps me understand but therapy it took me a while to understand Because I was the exact same way But when that lady told me she had another she said mr Sharper you arguing for right or you arguing to be right and she's saying about the communications manner in chinese and spanish I was like man Communication is everything yeah, it is and It's just it's just and i'm i'm not a great communicator. I'll be the first to admit i'm i'm a withdraw right So i'm just i'm the same way too. I just need space. I just I don't want to talk anymore. I'm the same I'm definitely the same I just don't want to talk about I try to avoid a lot of communication and confrontation You write I don't want to take it all the way there. I'm just gonna go ahead and give it to you right I was wrong. No, you just saying that you know, I said what? You said what you want. No, like that's it. If I elevate my voice you go to my why you doing that? I just said you was right. I was wrong, but you don't mean it Yeah, no, i'm definitely the same way but I feel like when you have somebody like you said like you just gave the perfect like Analysis is like when you don't have a dog in the fight Yes, you need to have somebody that really could be able to say right is right right wrong is wrong Correct. I'm saying like and and that's what therapy does for you Yes, it would be like and I was never like the type of person that felt comfortable opening up anyway Because one I don't want nobody to judge me correct two. I don't really want to feel Feel my business exactly I don't want you my business. I don't want to feel like certain emotions where it's just like I don't want to relive a situation. You feel me like if I feel like I've You've never really moved past it. You just Ball it up and put it in the back pocket and you try to run from reliving that situation, but sometimes you have to in order to really like Grow and being able to like deal with certain people because as humans we have triggers, you know Yeah, but you're Don't know what trigger you I'm saying so it's like you got to get over certain situations because you might treat somebody Who really good for you are doing right value because you got a certain trigger for something Yeah, you didn't live 10 years ago You got to heal and they don't even know about this situation So they wonder why you so mean to me or why you doing this or why you snap so quick? When we talk about this subject and you never talked about that trigger So like I feel like that's what like therapy is has done like therapy will help you From bleeding on somewhere that didn't even cut you exactly exactly because No matter where we go how big we Yeah, when you're in a relationship You're dealing with that person's trauma Be a childhood be a adolescent be it at some point you're gonna have to dress back Whatever it is and you have an issue and you're gonna have to address that trauma And if you don't get it addressed the person that you care about the most or that's with you at that point in time That's worth it. You don't feel it for sure. It's like I didn't really I understand that early on though Like I used to try to be so good at Going outside and smiling acting like I'm okay and like taking on masking that pain and just you find I'm saying like dealing with people Because I gotta be an artist I gotta take pictures I gotta do shows then when I come in the house, um releasing all that anger and this is like it's so I'm not being the right person that I should be to my girl To my mom. Yep to my kids the people who closest to me because I feel like I'm comfortable here and it's like I'm angry I'm pouting around like what did I do? You're taking out the people? That's the closest to you that you always do that And I had to really like learn to stop doing that like I ain't gonna lie my girl pops told me some of the really Shit, I ever heard in my life. He like bro I know you deal with a lot of shit, but just remember whatever you're going Look at that doormat and leave that shit outside bro. Like he told me that and I so he told me that probably Four years ago and I really think right there like if I go in the house and I'm angry I got an attitude like I try to like take some time to like breathe Because they don't got nothing to do with it Yeah You feel I'm saying like we take it out on the people that we sometimes the closest to us that we love the most Yeah, because he told me that he like bro I know you like I know you going through shit like I know and it had to be from conversations He have a word. Yes, you know say like bro, just leave it at the front door Right, you feel me like if something happened where it's like, all right bet she caused the problem or you know, like address it But like you can't go in there on defense mode where it's like you don't want to have certain conversations Are you upset because you didn't deal with this this this and this like she had nothing at the door You leave back out pick it up and address the world with that energy if you have to right leave it at the door at your house You've also worked with little dirt How difficult is to see him going through the situation that he's going through right now? That shit is it's painful for sure because I feel like the whole situation with with dirt is like that should happen to anybody in my opinion like in this field because You Moving fast, you don't know like who to trust or who doing yeah You can't be accountable for other people You know I'm saying like you feel me like and not even to speak on this situation because it's still he going through it It was like you can't be accountable for Situations or what other people have done or whatever the and you and a lot of times when you get that big People work overtime to try to pull you down to try to pull you off of that mountaintop You feel i'm saying and I feel like that's what happened to smirk. You know i'm saying it's like Me still like i'm not even gonna allow him to be like for real for like I know I'll feel it like I'll feel it I know he coming from under that shit like I know for a fact That's not the end of his story right he coming from under that shit You know what i'm saying is like a lot of times you kind of it's I hate to say but like Coming for you come from certain times god just like those situations at you so you could be able to see The the playing field for what is for like see who for you who not for you See the people that's counting you out and come back ten times stronger Like sometimes that shit just make you a different type of animal type of beast when you're just like hearing like damn Everybody counting me out you think it's over for me, huh? and then when you come out it's just like You better than you ever think like you feel i'm saying like I I know for a fact. That's what's gonna happen. That's work I mean my grandma say boy life will life will give you a lesson until it teach you what you need to know Now to keep giving it to you now you're gonna you're gonna hate Yeah, one way or another. Yeah, it's gonna learn you're gonna learn this lesson that's being taught and uh You but you're right when you're around people You don't know and the thing is the hardest thing is to trust and sometimes you trust the wrong people You put your trust in the wrong person and it's just Ain't no coming back from let me ask you this purchases You got some money that you say you get that bread for half a bill got a half a bill at 60 You're like, oh, okay What you when you first got your bread what you do? My first thing I did was I bought my mama house I moved my mama out Chicago far away and like I started like I ain't gonna lie just doing dope shit buying cars buying jewelry like going to the hood Everybody feel me saying like Shit like that, right like when I was 17 like i'm I was still outside on my block like all the time You feel and you got bread like that you still outside. Yeah still outside riding around through the neighborhood like I didn't I didn't Really like lock in and fully focus on my craft until I became like 22 23 years old like for real for real. I was still in in the hood and Going through all type of silly ass shit You feel me like you look back and have us like man, I squandered some man I squandered some damn good money on some foolishness Yeah, and it's like I feel like I wasted a lot of time where I really should have been like locked in better Like I feel like I feel like I would have 20 times more than I have now if I had that mentality early on because I would get up and I wouldn't go to the studio You know i'm saying like I wouldn't go to the studio. I would go outside I go shopping go buy clothes Go get high ride around my homies nims just doing shit like that and go to the studio When somebody called me to go to the studio, it wasn't my man said like I wouldn't wake up Like I want to go to the studio. It would have to be for my manager somebody like yeah We got a studio book. I need you to do this. I need you to do that like my man said was never owned music It was your own being in the streets. I woke up and wanted to be in the streets like every day. So The purchases are limitless. Like I was bad all type of like just car. I used to back cars And I was just so young and frat I had money like I could have built my credit up I never wanted to put a car in my name. Like I used to just tell people like yeah, go give me a car Any way you can like I just pay you and I lose the car impound it and never go get it back Go get another car like what because I was so frat. I'm like, I don't want the car in my name shit Anything happen is my fucking don't need to be in my name But you building credit like that though. I didn't know none about no credit ain't nobody tell me like I'm glad when talking about credit because I've heard it with You started getting the money your credit was like yeah, but when I got some of this shit When I got when I got When I when I um, I was in the league man, I couldn't even I had to get a co-signer to get a car Really? Yeah But that's because we don't get taught about credit though. Ain't nobody teach nobody about credit like you right about it so it's like I and My mom and them like they knew about it, but I kind of like shutting them out. You feel me like my mom's and my pops this is what I really regret though, like when it come to Family, I should have let my family in more because they had my best interest Yeah, and I was like shutting them out because I felt like Man, y'all don't know what y'all talking about. Y'all ain't never had no money like this. How y'all telling me? And I really should have listened My pops was trying to tell me to like build your credit go through this building like I was I ran through like six cars in one year like Buy a Porsche crash and do something by being by this by a jag like shit like that. Just stupid You got kids now What type of dad are you trying to be? What what type of what type of example are you trying to set for your kid? um For real for real. I want to like Like just being a hunter like being honest bro. I just want to be a hundred with my kids I just want to be honest and let them know Like the harsh realities are like the world. Okay, the stuff that i've been through to get to where I am You found saying it especially with having a daughter, I want to let her know like Niggas ain't shit like Niggas ain't shit. You found saying like I was this kind of man, baby You feel i'm saying like you're gonna deal with this like you beautiful you're gonna deal with this and just understand But make your own decisions as a woman. Yeah what you want to do, but know right from wrong Know what's right know what a man's intentions is regardless and then you make your decision based off of that right, like especially for my daughter and for my sons, I want them to and I think a lot of people who like got money and made it out and have kids that's like Born out of poverty think like this like I want my kids to Know how it feels to work hard and earn something. Yes. Yeah, like Something just know how it feels to work hard and earn and with my oldest son. I see it like He's very spoiled and privileged so when I try to like be stern and discipline him I feel like a conversation and go Further than a whooping like I can't really hit him all the time when he's doing wrong, right? I gotta talk to him and tell him like This is what you did This is what I feel like you should have done. This is what Happens if you keep on going down this road if i'm saying he only seven years old So I gotta talk to him and have them kind of conversations like I want to be that dad where you like You could trust me. You feel me like and my father was And I get that from my father But I didn't I was naive why I felt like I shouldn't talk to him And I couldn't talk to my dad about anything I was going through and he wouldn't judge me He would help me like I was afraid because For a long time I feared my dad You know, like it's I mean you're supposed to feel your parents, you know But you should like respect them and feel comfortable enough where you can talk to him Yeah Like I would lie to him before I tell him the truth because I was afraid of what he might think or what he might do I don't want my kids to feel like they got a lot of me I want my kids to feel like they could tell me the truth and I might be highly disappointed You know what i'm saying? But you gotta tell me the truth and I didn't learn that about my dad until I became an adult When I became an adult me and my dad got real close like we became best friends But for years I didn't communicate with him about certain shit and he was right there like he was with my mom in the house with me and I wouldn't tell him certain shit because it's like I feared him until I didn't you know what i'm saying? So it's like got to a point where it's like You know, I ain't scared of you no more. I don't gotta tell you shit You know what I mean? Like I don't want my kids to ever feel like that with me Why was it important for you to wait until you became financially stable before you had kids? Um, yeah, that was that was mandatory for me I had to like I just felt like The stuff that I seen like With my family and people around like I wanted to be able to Provide for my kids and be able to like do it comfortably right? I couldn't I couldn't see myself Having a baby and i'm just still on knucklehead shit Right from saying like I could you obey or you a baby yourself baby. Yeah, exactly So it's like I didn't I knew like, you know how you get that gut feeling that intuition like all right It's cool. I could have a kid like you get to a point where like you get Enough success or money like I could have a kid because I want to have a kid I don't even gotta have to be with the mama if I don't want to you feel i'm saying like that was kind of like My mentality when I was growing up like, you know, like i'm like hell no I ain't I ain't having no kid right now at all because I don't want to deal with like no baby mama shit and not having to Control where it's like, you know when women get upset they do spiteful stuff, especially when money evolves Correct sense so it's like no matter what I want to always be in a position where Even if we not cool or on the best of terms or whatever I could provide for you because you're the mother of my child or provide for my kid Like I understood that because i've seen it so many times i've seen my aunties Crashing out and doing the worst of the worst because you mad about the smallest thing You know i'm saying that really could just be a conversation and me the most frustrated when we broke Yeah, so it's like you don't want to talk you don't want to have conversations you don't want to do this and you just be like Like you might neglect your kid you might neglect your baby mama or whatever the case just because you like I need to go Get some money. I don't even want to talk to you. So you miss it so much. It's like I never wanted to be that guy right Your your son's on social media. Yeah, and he went viral because he said stop calling me a y ain't calling me a y Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and I mean that had made me proud Now you took the words out after that had to make you feel good. Yeah. No, that made me super proud, man It's like my kid. He's he's really smart. Your son is very very smart. He's very articulate like He and I don't even know what made him say that you know i'm saying it's like Because he look up to me don't get me wrong like He'd look up to me he Like read stuff like he know like i'm come from the streets. I've been through certain stuff and it's like He just was like I don't want to be classified as no y in you know Does he ask you about does he ask you about your upbringing? He does he ask you a little bit about what? Yeah, he do like he asked me about like certain stuff like what I did to ever be arrested right and if like Like asked me about like my homies who passed away He's i'm saying shit like that like what happened what happened when you got shot because he it's all it's all public record Yep, he can see it.

You could enjoy music your dad a rapper. Yes But don't fall so deep into it where you want to like idolize it And be that and be that you know so I had to have that conversation with him and his mom even called me like I don't know what's wrong with him when he think he like tough. You know what i'm saying? She's like you ain't tough boy. Your wife's living a penthouse up here Like you know i'm saying like you ain't never had a tough day in your life So like I had to have these conversations with him, you know, and then it's like My son is A regular kid, but he is celebrity. So everybody like boost them up and let them get away with it Like yeah, yo son is is cute to them You know i'm saying it's like it's cool when you seven but then when you get 17 18 You're gonna be a problem. You think is that you know i'm saying so Um, I had those conversations with him what he know for sure like nah, that's not what we're doing like co-parenting Um, you make it work. Mm-hmm. I mean you're gonna be thank god Um For me man, i'm not gonna lie. It's like I always just With women you gotta be able to forgive like you know what i'm saying Yeah, you gotta be able to forgive and you gotta be able to hold yourself accountable. Yeah when you do wrong, you know for sure Exactly. So it's like that's how we operate. That's not how I don't want to talk about what you did Don't worry about what I did. We'll talk about that later. We could be 20 never Yeah For sure. So like with me I just I promise bro. I always like feel like man It's gonna be all right Like should it get greater later? Like whenever i'm going through shit with my girl even at home While I was going through show my babe mama. Yeah I just always was able to like forgive And sometimes my girls get mad at me like you just forgive her all the time Like no matter what she doing is like I don't really take it personal because it's like I know for a fact i'm not going like no I'm not gonna say I don't take it personal. I took a lot of shit personal when you're young And you're young so I know For the love of my son. I can't hate you. You're right. I'm saying like I feel like that'll make me a bad dad it's certain people who really like Start hating a babe mama. So now it kind of like They dictate how you parent your child correct? I'm saying like I never wanted to be that guy and guess what? That situation will never change and always go be the mother of your child So whether you see six months he's six 16 26 36 regardless Yeah, and I never wanted my son to grow up and be like to see y'all treating my mama bad You feel me? Like so that was always something that like I just was like man I got the short end of the stick a lot a lot a lot Just trying to be like man. I just I just want this shit to work somehow. I'm saying because it's like You my woman. I love you. You feel I'm saying right? It's my son mom If I'm saying i'm gonna have love for them regardless, you know Because it's my son mom and I love my son unconditionally and I have to no matter what like even if i'm upset my son He's smart as shit. I could be mad Me his mama probably was arguing or some shit and then it's like when I pick him up I don't want to like argue have that energy around energy around i'm gonna be like hey, what's up? Right get my son get in the car, you feel i'm saying like shit like that So it's like I always was able to just like a fan caught up shit on the rug a fan called a disagreement You seem to know what's happening with one of your kids, uh in the car. Yeah, it's just like what am I? With tiana. Yeah, no, you know, it's so crazy. It was recently like right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So This situation me and her wasn't arguing right she was frustrated because Actually me and my security him right there I was arguing with this guy right Me and him So it was like a situation when he was in the club and I had like words with a security guard and just telling him like man move around get away from me and Uh, I think he did something that offended my girl, right? Like, you know, and I was like telling him like you feel i'm saying telling him like He did something that offended her and he was like kind of like my security was just like All right, cool. I know him like he was like i'm trying to tell her to explain this story like explaining He was like talking back to me. So me and him just me and my we like this like brothers So it's like we had those heated arguments And when i'm when i'm on 10 i'm on 10, right? I really like Ain't no reason ain't no ratchet i'm already on 10 So my window is down right and tiana kept telling me like let your window down I mean let your window up you arguing somebody's finna catch you Somebody's like she know like she don't she don't play that shit. She don't want to go viral She don't want no type of nothing like you feel i'm saying she telling me like let your window up Somebody's going to record you arguing because it's fans walking out. I'm not listening to her. I didn't care. I'm already We already here. We already heated i'm like man all that so when the Girl walked up. She just catched me arguing but she catched tiana like with an attitude too Like telling me like let your window up. I'm steady telling you let your window up and she see the girl recording So they thought I was arguing with her. I never was arguing with her. I was arguing with my security. Yeah, it was him Women carterby said it's more allowed Do you see a woman to go after a man in a relationship as opposed to a man going after a woman in a relationship? so Like I don't really get what she meant by that She said women like I said for guys in a relationship It's more likely that a woman would approach a man Knowing he's in a relationship as opposed to a man knowing a woman is in a relationship would approach her I believe you agree. Yeah, I agree with it. I think I do too. I agree with her because hey You introduced you. Hey, how you doing? I got a man Once you tell me you got a man. I'm good. Yeah, you can't have no friends. Yeah, you know I ain't nothing you you told me you got a man. I'm cool with that Exactly, I'm cool because I already know how men are men men might not even like that woman Yeah, but let another man show interest in exactly now you got a problem. I don't want no problem. Absolutely Because i'm just going by what she said. She said she didn't have nobody She got somebody. Yeah. Well, let me take that back. She might not have him but he got her Right So it's still a problem for sure and then it's like when women I ain't understand it early on, you know Because I was I was raised by women for real. Yeah, so I understand that I understand like Women like I heard some real shit when I was young like women emotions are like like oceans like men say what they mean women say what they feel correct, you know, so it's like when you When you're dealing with a woman, especially if you in love with her you love your woman and you're doing right by her Women are trying to really come between it I'm saying it really try to like, you know, just Want what the next woman got correct? I'm saying like I feel like men don't really do that Like men don't really be like, oh, yeah, I want this because so and so got it. They just yeah Like that's not really in our nature. You feel me? So I definitely agree with her when she say that for sure And then you thinking about it Certain men would not like if you guys sense common sense like me and you guys like You know the certain men gonna go to the furthest extent about a woman Like some of the biggest empire some of the biggest world the wars in the world Over a woman, yes, I'm saying so it's like if you're not really willing to Risk your life or risk your freedom and do certain shit behind Trying to pursue a woman and you know That that's probably what come with it. It's like nine times out of ten Most men just gonna wash their hands you got it when they see it getting to a certain extent You feel I'm saying like so women not like that though when women feel that friction from a woman and they're going back They just keep going. Yeah, it's the opposite right? I saw I saw this thing the other day. Let me know what you think They said like men would probably if a woman if his girl Significant other whatever the case may be cheated on him If his friends didn't know homeboys didn't find out he would probably take her back But it's when the homies and the friends find out. Yeah, he can't do it. Yeah That's a lot yeah, it's like nah, I can't yeah for sure absolutely that's that's why you keep your stuff off the internet That's why you keep people out of your business. You can work a lot of things out You and her for sure but the moment because if you date publicly you got to break up publicly If everybody's in your business, then they know you date such a such when you break up Everybody gonna be in your business and know why you broke up. Yeah, no definitely and like I feel like I definitely feel like that's true. It's like when If you love somebody enough You can see past a lot of you can you can you can work past it? You know what I'm saying, but then when you got a lot of people you know, you know The sharp I know I know I know you ain't gonna put over that The sharp I know that's tough I've been knowing man, I know you're 40 years. That's tough. That's tough for sure Because it's like as a as a man like, you know, we possessive as well. Yeah, that's mad. Yeah, I'm saying like this is mad so like Even if your girl might have stepped out on you or did certain shit It's like you really deep down don't want to see her with nobody else You feel me like you don't want to see her with nobody else But your pride about let you like all right, but you lose her and you might really live your whole life and regret like yeah I'm just the one I let get away. Yeah, I'm saying like I didn't see that shit happen a lot of times like With my uncles like people in my family. I didn't seen it happen a lot. You found me saying that I think my mom and dad like lasted and been together 30 40 years because No matter what my daddy was not letting my mama leave. I didn't seen my mama try to leave my daddy a couple times He would not she he wouldn't let her go they took that death do a part Like I know for a fact my mama didn't try to leave my daddy at least three four times, right Can men be in platonic relationships with women? Can you have a best friend? That's a woman I believe so. I really believe you can for sure. It's just like certain men Like if you attracted to a woman, that's another thing. I think that's what yeah, that's that's the problem That's what make it frustrating You can't be attracted to your best friend because y'all know too much about each other Right. Only y'all gonna damn to try each other at some point. Yeah, I'm saying but I definitely do feel like that though like, you know, like, um I've seen it for sure. Like I've never I've seen it for sure. Like I've never I think just because I was in the streets. I never like Befriended a woman before right? Okay, because I just know like women's emotions Like I just feel like I could never really trust a woman unless I'm in an intimate relationship with them Great. I couldn't trust a woman to just be my friend and know shit about me Only person I open up to is my woman. Yeah So are you coming up on 30? uh Marry me. Hey, they say something else man. I need something You got you take the bottle it's she smooth man, hey So Marriage in the future. I mean you I mean you want more kids you want a wife That's that's where i'm at with life. Like that's my next step. I'm i'm trying to get married like for real I'm about to marry my woman. I think I was you gonna do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm about to marry and I was really just like Like Just that elevation and growth like I was always that i'm a critical thinker. Yeah steps ahead I didn't want to get married so I could afford a ring that cost 300,000. Yeah Awareness a million like shit like that. Like I was always on that type of time Yeah, I always envisioned myself to have it you feel me right? I kind of Cut my relationship short because she didn't want she didn't even want that like need all that. That's what I was on Right, let me go get you money Let me go get the money do this and do that and get in the comfort through space where it's like All right, I could do it right. You know big weddings are to impress other people that is for you and your girl And I wanted to impress other people But it was still like for her too though because when a woman feel like it's like right you don't you won't get to Experience that again. You know what I'm saying? Like you only get one life You only get one real dream wedding and shit like that You feel I'm saying but like why I am right now though, like I'm I definitely I can't wait to marry my girl So that's the only we get what we talk we talking about year two years. Yeah for sure. Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready to like You ready to do that thing now you see you see One knee right now ready to go home Drill rep are you shocked that new york and uk taking over drill rep honestly I'm not i'm gonna be honest really because like I feel like Chicago kind of lost touch with drill like just the What I mean by that is like The production the sound you know, like the uptempo shit. Yeah in Chicago drill It always was about like street shit. You know, I'm saying you talking about gangsta shit, right? Talking about gangsta shit, right? But I think Chicago just got two gangsta where they just talking about It ain't even like appealing like what drill came out that shit You could play that shit. It'll turn the whole club up right like turn everything up and When new york and the uk learned to master that they mastered and started making hits from it I haven't heard a a real drill hit from Chicago. That's undeniable and so long like Yeah, the young niggas they go up they talk about street shit and shit But it's like I feel like we lost that touch of drill and new york and the uk especially the uk still got it Yeah, for sure. Like it's kind of dying out a little bit in new york But in the uk 100 like they got it when it comes to the drill wave You know what i'm saying? Like i'm gonna get it to my tail my hat as one of the pioneers of you know I'm saying drill rep. Um And I think that's only because You have to no matter what you rapping about that shit gotta be catchy bro Yes, they stay still making undeniable hits On the drill shit, you know i'm saying it's like i'm a fan of it. I'll listen to it myself All right, we're gonna get you out of here on this one Tell us about the album and what made you choose the photo that you chose for um I just wanted to like Go back and like remind the world of Who I am like what it took to get here like where I come from You feel i'm saying because I could really be dead on jail right now, you know, and i've done so much and I had a conversation with my manager would make he told me like bro You don't really understand like how much legendary shit like you didn't really did like you really like somebody that's Influenced the impact of so many lives and done so much and you got so much to go Yeah, like you have you still have your trajectory is so high after you've come a long way But you still got a long way to go. Like it's still looking good for you. You know what i'm saying? And When he said that I just started like going back looking at my old videos like Looking at old interviews and like googling like my old pictures when I was a kid and I came across those mugshots i'm like I'm trying to make this my album cover I'm saying like I wanted to like paint that picture and tell a story like i've been doing it At a high level kind of since I was a teenager, but at that time I was really like I was up against a lot like that kid on that mugshot could not be here right now You feel i'm saying? Yeah, and I wanted to like people to see the pain in my ass like when I put the First announcement out my first mugshot. I was like 11 years old I couldn't believe it like I seen that picture like I was a kid. I looked like yo son going to jail I couldn't picture me seeing my son with a mugshot. You know what i'm saying? That just lets you know what we was up against early on you feel me? It could have went totally left, but I did it right like I went the right way. You know what i'm saying? And That's what I wanted to like show the world because i'm always Don't get me wrong. I got my core fan base the people who love and support me But i'm trying to tell that story to the people who never heard me ever before like never heard my name So that's what I wanted to like, you know, because you might hit g herbo and all you probably know is went legit, right? You don't know nothing about walking the face over there You don't know nothing about that kid that was 15 16 years old on the block freestyling and made it from there to here You feel me?
