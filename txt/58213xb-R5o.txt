Y'all, what's up? I'm going to be on tour, specifically Portland, Oregon, Spirit Mountain Casino, November 8th, 2025, one show, 7 p.m. I'm also going to be at Reno, Nevada at the Grand Sierra Resort at 8 p.m. December 6th, 2025. December 6th, come check it out, y'all. Yeah, yeah. Have you done it? I did it because you posted it. I posted it yesterday. How long can you hold your breath? I could hold it longer than you. I'll tell you that. No fucking way. I could hold my breath. There's no way you could hold your breath. Yeah, you'd sick in. Oh, Captain Vape. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even with my vape, I can fucking hold it all the time. Captain Vape. But we gotta put our heads underwater or something. We can't just do it like this. Yeah. It'd be honor system. Oh. You're gonna play the honor system with Bobby? Damn, dude. There's no way Bobby's gonna- You know, Bobby's gonna- They call me K.A.M., dude. You know what K.A.M. is? King something? No, Korean Aquaman. Oh. That's what they've been calling me for years, dude. The K.A.M. dude. Korean Aquaman. You wanna do it now? Let's see. No, do the one- Let's hold our breath. Is it- No, but hang on. You gotta do the one where it tells you like it takes you around a lap on a course, you know? Oh, that's cool. There's like a visual? Yeah, it's like a visual going like you are- You have dead lungs. You have medium lungs. Oh, that's funny. You have a Navy SEAL's lungs. I always have Navy SEAL lungs. You do? Yeah, but I hold my breath. Yeah, dude. No, but how long can you hold your breath? I don't know. I've never done it before. You wanna have a contest? Yeah, let's have a contest. It's a fascinating podcasting with contests. Yeah. You have to do the nose hold. Why? Because that's how we know it's legit. Oh, yeah. Really? Yeah. All right. Well, I'll hold my nose. No, I'll hold your nose. I'll hold your nose. I'll hold your nose. I hold your nose. You hold my nose. All right. All right. Wait, wait. Do you want to hold both our noses? Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You hold both our noses. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Kat, you hold both our noses. Okay. But hang on. Let me see what this one is. Hit start. And by the way, if everyone wants to play- I need red bulls for this. Unless you're driving. Okay. Yeah. No, no. If you're driving- No, no, no, no, no. Okay. Wait, what's the restart? It's right here. You have basically four seconds to inhale. Here we go. Ready? Follow it along on screen. Get ready. It's going to stop pretty soon. And now. Okay. Kat, whose nose is more oily? Definitely Bobby. I can't tell. Stay locked in, Bobby. Bert's fading. Damn, guys. This is crazy. It's more than 25 seconds. Keep going. I'm on a timer. I'm out. Did Bobby beat me? I did. Korean Aquaman beat me? I'm Korean Aquaman. I could see underwater for five minutes. You should be collecting sponges. Korean Aquaman. Really? You couldn't beat me? No, I panicked. I panicked because I was like, he should be out by now. I was like, there's no way Bobby's left. I'm half dead, dude. Bobby, that's incredible. Is that Ozempic, do you think? No, it's not Ozempic, dude. That's not a thing. Fucking Google comes up. It's not a thing. Yeah. Yeah. How many cigarettes are you smoking a day? I smoke a pack a day. You'll never beat me. You're right. You're right. I think it's mental. Dude, my mental game is namaste, dude. Namaste. Yeah, Steven saw it all in mine, dude. Kalada, you know what I just did? Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Ready? Oh, she'll beat all of us. I know. She's a deep sea diver. She's a deep sea diver. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You'll beat all of us. Kalada. You're a pretty good diver too. No, no, no, no. I just beat him in a fucking breathing contest. You know what it is? It's a mind game. I feel so good right now. Yeah. I usually can hold my breath for a minute and 25 seconds, but that's because I do it in bed by myself with no one watching. You just do apnea training just for a shit-some game? Leann's not watching you or anything? No, I'm just doing it myself. I'm good under pressure though. You know why he's really good? Because he has already sleep apnea. And so he probably holds his breath in his sleep like normally for like three minutes at a time. Three, four am, dude, I'm dead for like 20 minutes. And he wakes up abruptly and like his whole body. Yeah. And I start dancing. Yeah. As soon as I wake up, I start dancing. I have sleep apnea, but I don't know. I don't believe I have sleep apnea. You have it. No one does. No one does. I don't think anyone does. You have it. I don't think anyone does. Look at your youth. I think it's bullshit just like tennis. But no, but it isn't bullshit. Do you not wear a CPAP? No. Okay. Here's the deal. All right. So you're telling me if we go into a technological pandemic, meaning, energy cuts out, energy cuts out, and we all have to live on fire and water that we have in our tub. That doesn't know anything. Okay. Joe Coy would die. This makes sense. He would die. So Joe Coy would die. Why? I think people who- Hang on a second. So just so we're clear, Joe Coy, was it not for him having money, should be dead. Yeah. What? Wow. Wow. What do you mean? Joe Coy is- I'm with you, dude, but what do you mean? Joe Coy- I'm following along now. Is but a gift of technology. Joe Coy should not exist. Joe Coy should be dead because without technology, he would not be alive. It's true. Well, I'll explain it to Bobby in simple terms. No, because he has sleep apnea. But such severe sleep apnea. So when you have sleep apnea, you're actually not receiving the oxygen in your body for extended periods of time. I have it. You're preaching in the choir, God. Your heart becomes enlarged. Your heart becomes enlarged. A lot of these things, your memory starts to go, like your body starts to deteriorate. Yeah, I know. I have it. I know, and I bought you the machine. Yeah, and I don't use it anymore. I don't use it ever. Yeah. You have yours? It's crazy to put a scuba diving mask on and then go to bed. I know. It's crazy. As a matter of fact, I think I'd rather be found dead in a bed than alive and with one of those masks on. Like it's crazy. I did the test. They took me down to Ventura and they took- or not Ventura, but Ventura's- He doesn't listen. And they take you up in a building, like a building, right? Like a building, like seven story building. They walk you into a waiting room. It's a waiting room. The lady says, are you ready? And then she takes you into a serial killer's bedroom. As if a serial killer rented an office and said, I will kill people in this room. Because it is made up like a bed. There's pictures and there's curtains. Is there blood? No, but it looks like a psychopath's bedroom. Okay. Because it's in the middle. It's in a fucking industrial building. If I was a serial killer, I wouldn't kill you. You know why? I wouldn't know where to hide your body. What would you hide in? Can you imagine? Bobby trying to get rid of my body? Trying to dismember. Just drag it to the next room. I know that's what I'm saying. I said to Leanne yesterday, if I was a serial killer, I would kill people for little offenses, societal offenses. And then at the very end, I say, I'll let you go if you can figure out why I'm killing you. That's awesome. What kind of societal offenses? So there was a girl yesterday at Farm Boy who was going through her Raya on speaker phone with her best friend. And I was having to listen to it without having the privilege of seeing who she was talking about. So she's like, well, he's got a blue check. He says he's friends with RFK. And I'm like, who the fuck is this? Wait, hold on. I want to guess who this is. I'm like, who is this? I think I know who it is. I think I know who it is. Yeah. Give me the age range. She was young. I know. But the guy she was talking about. No, it's not. It's your friend. Joe Biden. Joe Biden on Raya. I bet you it is. Bleep that. He's killing it. He's 90 years old. What? So you'd kill her. No, what I'd do is I very easily could have followed her home. I very easily could have. She was totally not paying attention to anything. Like she walked to her on speaker, flipping through Raya, talking to her friend, got in the car. And I was like, okay, very easily. Can I follow her home? Right. I follow her home, get her parking garage, get it. Hold the elevator, hold the elevator. And then I get in the elevator with her. And then I'd attack her. And then I'd take her to my house or I'd take her. I'd wait until she got in her room. And then I'd bind her up. And then I'd say, I'd be like, just so you know, there's a reason I'm killing you. Do you know what it is? I'm going to give you three guesses. And she'd be like, you're a fucking lunatic. I go, that's wrong. You could have been right, but that's wrong. I don't know. Can I be the girl? Yeah. What are you doing? So much moaning. So much moaning. No, because I'm not that right. And I'm coming to you're having a orgasm while you're. It's called acting. Why are you coming? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Deep like this. I thought it was on auto tune. No, okay. Let me, let me do it. I made a wrong. Okay. Okay. Are you ready? You're unconscious. You're unconscious. Okay. I know. Okay. You ready? Hold your breath. Hold your breath. Hey, wake up. Wake up. Yeah. Oh my God. What's going on? Hey, you've been tied up. Not good. No, no, you're doing. Why'd you shake your head? No, this is so dark. Okay. I know I'm going to sound like a lunatic. Although you haven't fantasized about killing people before. Yeah. Yeah. You're not living. Yeah. Right. If you haven't at times been like, I'm not certain that person deserves to exist. I should probably. Yeah. Okay. A lot of people like that. You're nodding a little too hard over there. Can we go with the scene? Okay. Yeah. I'm in the role right now. I can't hold it. I can't hold it. Okay. Wake up. Wake up. Yes. I'm awake. Who are you? What's going on? So I'm going to tell you all my information because I'm probably. What's going on? You're asking too many questions. Oh. Okay. That's not why I'm killing you. I'm going to let you guess three guesses of why I'm killing you. Okay. What? Three guesses. You've done something to offend society and I am here to help you repent. I let my cats out at night. For the coyotes. You're worried. For the coyotes. Yeah. Do you really? Yeah. No, he doesn't. I don't. Oh, no, no, no. I meant is this character really lets her cat out? Yes. That's what I'm doing. No, it's not that. It's not that. But that is horrible to your cats. No, it's not that. That's why I'm kind of throwing out things. Jesus Christ. As a character, I'm like, what would it be? Why I would get killed here? I don't see this person as a cat person. If I'm being totally honest. The person that's captured. Yeah. How do you know her bit? She has like a. I'm so sorry. How do you know me? Don't cut that. Yeah. Lady. A small dog. Probably a hypoallergenic labradoodle. Back to scene. Okay. Okay. It's because I haven't called my dad in 20 years. No, no. People are allowed to have problems in their, in their family and make decisions. Yeah. Is it because I microwave my frogs? Wow. So it's alive. I microwave frogs alive. It's just, I like the pop sound. You know what I mean? One minute to take pop, pop, you know, it's cleaning the microwave. It's crazy. It's all got this green goo. It's not that. I'm going to give you one more guess. Serial killer stuff. Serial killer stuff. Yeah. I'm the victim. I know. Say crazy stuff. Yeah. Okay. What do you eat? The director? Go crazy. Go crazy. Yeah. Go crazy. Yeah. Okay. Is it because that I have a collection of baby toes? Oh, a clutch as in a purse. I think he said collection. I have a collection of baby toes. Wait, are you the serial killer? I don't know. You should be crazy. I know you got to out crazy him. So he backs off. Yeah. But that's not the part. Actually right now I'm like, you know what? I kind of want to leave you alone because you're a lot of girl and I want you to meet this person on Raya, but I was going to kill you because of Raya. Oh, because of Raya. Oh, because of Raya. Oh, can then do it. Can I masturbate when you do it? Jesus Christ. What a fantasy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When you stab me, I'm going to just start touching my clitoris. What's the craziest thing you'd allow a girl to stay during sex, Bobby, that would not turn you on? What's your boundaries during sex where you'd say that's too far. I've got to tap. Don't say nothing. Oh, like really don't say nothing dog. Wait, so just shut up. You don't want her talking. What's the craziest thing she could say that you're like, okay, this is scary. I need to get out of here. I mean, things that will hurt my family. Like, is that it? That would hurt me. Yeah. That's all of it. When she got naked, she went like this Oh, look at that guy. Oh, I would probably, I would do it. Yeah. But then kill myself later. Yeah. We should invite someone else. Oh, wow. That could be, that could be hard. Well, yeah. But then you know what I would do? What it was. I tried to jam my testicles inside the vag too, to fill the gaps. Let's go back to the frogs. Do you realize that's not anatomically like possible. You would have to bend your dick and then push up. What do you mean? I think you can jam your balls. Yeah. Use my hands and just like pack it. Would you take your balls from behind or would you grab like this and shove in? What do you mean? I don't understand. Would you reach from behind and push in or would you just reach like this? Well, it's in from the bottom. So I'm missionary and I would just, you know what I mean? With my hands, I would reach around like I'm grabbing around. Guys, do you feel like podcast is over? Do you feel like why are we doing this? Yeah, you're right. You guys are leading me down a path of despair. It was fun while it lasted, but let's just let Rogan do it. Let's all just go back to doing stand-off. I don't know why we have podcasts. No one prompted you with a whole shove the balls thing. That was all you. No, but you gave me the scenario. No, no, no, no. This is the problem with podcasting is we've talked about everything. I know that's the problem. Now we're forced to think of things we've never said and where we end up is shoving balls in a pussy. Yeah. Frogs exploding in the microwave. I mean, that's a new thing. I swear to God, I've been toying the idea of getting rid of all my podcasts just because it's like, it's like, I'm not a fucking broadcaster. Yeah, me either. Like what are we fucking doing? What is you know what we should do now? Hang on. Now there's a safe search. It is physically impossible for a person to insert their testicles into a vagina. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. I've never seen it on porn. Yeah, me either. Theoretically doesn't work. Okay. I get it. Balls were like filled with blood in the same way a boner is and it's like hard enough to enter. It's getting too dirty. Let's switch gears. It's mushy. Can we do that? That's intro. That's intro. Let's do a little ginger to clear our palate. Yeah. Balls. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Anyway, welcome. Thank you. Yeah. Oh, you know what? Okay. I don't know what that means, but okay. All right. So this is what I want to do. Very good idea. We've talked so much on podcasts. Yeah. I keep repeating the same things over and over again. I think we should, you and I, try to come up with stuff that we've never talked about. I love Bill.

I think we should, you and I, try to come up with stuff that we've never talked about. Okay. No, don't put on notes. No, no, no, no. I write down ideas for standup. I don't never say them in podcasts. Yeah. Because standup is standup. I think maybe- Standup's where all my original ideas go and then podcasting is where all this shit I go. I'd never say this on stage goes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, Gilbert, can you come up with some ideas? Here, here, here. Okay. He'll chat GBT at maybe. I am. You are? Yeah. I'll give you some standup, like some standup premises. I don't want to hear your act. No, it's not an act. It's ideas. What is up? What's happening? Don't you have a fucking- Okay, like I have ideas where I go, this wouldn't work on stage, but it's a good talking point. Like the other day, I'll tell you, okay, I'll give you a perfect idea. Okay, good. You ready for this? Yeah. I did this on Two Bears, so now I've said it twice, but it's a good idea. Tommy and I are adopting a OnlyFans girl for Two Bears. We're going to have Two Bears OnlyFans girl, and then we're going to help run her OnlyFans, create her OnlyFans, generate content for her OnlyFans, produce her OnlyFans, and help blow her up so she can make a ton of money. Kind of like a kill-tony of OnlyFans, like someone who's good and talented, but only has a minute, and you at Bad Friends should do the same thing. Kind of like you're fostering. Yeah. Yeah. Is it a boy or a girl? We haven't made a decision yet. It's got to be a guy. It's got to be a guy. It could be both. Why? Because it's a little creepy, no? No. No. No. Okay, hang on. I don't understand why everyone doesn't have an OnlyFans. Like, for real, if I had boobs, I'd have an OnlyFans. There's no reason not to have an OnlyFans. That's why I don't have one. Yeah. But you have feet. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But they're crazy that you can make $10,000 a month. They look like gargoyles feet. Okay. They don't look like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You ever look at Bill as a- Have you ever thought about having an OnlyFans? No. As like a thing with my podcast, but not in like a sexual way, no. God, maybe I just have lower standards. You would have one. No. You get naked for free. Like, what do I show? Me and you are naked. You're dick. What are you talking about? What do I show? Your butthole. I would do- I would do one with you. Yeah. Okay. Let's create an OnlyFans, you and I. I would do it in a heartbeat. Okay, but- I don't understand what the fuck- I understand that, but what are we doing in it? Dude, whatever our fans want us to do. Yeah. I feel like, no, you shouldn't be at the mercy of that. You should set your own- That's how you make the fucking cash. But I think you can go like full blown asshole like first day. You got to go slowly easy. Yeah. We're not going full blown asshole. Bro. Yeah. I know. I mean, like I'm- He only goes full blown asshole. I can't understand. Why you wouldn't? Like, no, I can't understand like if I just posted, if someone's like, send me a picture of your asshole, and I sent them a picture of my asshole. How would they know it's your asshole? And who cares if it is or isn't? Yeah, no, it's gonna like- It's not like someone's gonna go, look at this asshole. Yeah. I know the first photo we do. What? Assholes? No, no, no. Yours is hairless. I've seen your- You know what? I've seen your asshole. I know. I understand that. It's for free. But the public hasn't. Wait, you don't have any hair on your asshole? No, there's hair free. He has no hair. He's like a fucking- You need to show the world that. Yeah. You know what my asshole's like? What? Remember in Lord of the Rings, right? Yeah. You know, they go into the mines of Moyer and they can't find the door opening? It's all the same down there. Right? And then they say Elvish and then the door thing opens. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry, I read the book. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know the first photo we do. What? Hunter gatherer. Oh, so you're going with themes. Yeah, we'll do a theme. Okay. You're a hunter, right? I like this. You have, you know what I mean, a spear. And I have a basket. I'm just picking fruit. And so- And holding his breath. So tastefully nude? Yeah, it's- It's- Every photo gets more explicit. See, we're naked. It sounds like a calendar. It feels like a calendar. The first one, yeah, but then it'll get into, you know what I mean? We'll go into the crusades. October. Yeah, yeah. And it'll get- I can't understand that any woman's broke when you could just do only fans. Okay. I feel like it's maybe over-saturated. It's hard to be like the 1% earner. Well, I don't know. I have friends that are like, that get messages from random guys that are like, if you just wear these shoes for a week or something, I'll give you five grand. And I'm like, where are those guys? I've never had those guys. But hang on. Hang on. You haven't fielded those. This is great. If you're listening right now, you haven't fielded those questions. Oh yeah, hey. Like what would people pay to see you wear? Like there's weird fetishes. Like when I met my wife, my wife had a pair of fry knee-high boots. The second I met her, I was like, light tan. And I was like, God damn it. Those are hot. And I just, I was like, her naked in those boots. Holy shit. Now as a fan sitting off- I don't want to visualize that. That is so sexy. It's so fucking hot. And by the way, sidebar, I saw a bunch of girls wearing those exact same boots at a Florida State game. And I was like, oh my God. Let me ask you, if you got a divorce with Leanne- She'd have to die. Keep going. It's hypothetical, man. I would not get a divorce with her. I would murder her before I got a divorce. I would murder her and get rid of the body and then fucking stand at a podium and be like, I'm so lost. Hypothetically though. Hypothetically, we get a divorce and I murder her. Okay. No, she's still alive. I bring her back to her life. The murder was unsuccessful. She's been able to escape. Yeah. Okay. She dropped the- Okay. You guys heard my murdering techniques earlier. She dropped the charges. Yes. All right. Yes. You can be free. Okay. Leanne and I get a divorce. And then you find out that I'm dating Leanne. Oh my God. All right. Let's be real. Let's put it- No, it's for suicide. No, I call you. All right. And I'm Leanne because I'm a man and I man up. Yeah. And I'm real and I'm going to be very mindful. I look at you, right? And I go, listen, dude, I've always had feelings for her. And she, you know, it's been a year. She gives great gift baskets. She gives great gift baskets. I have a hairless ass. She bought me some knives, you know what I mean? And some chopsticks. Cause she did buy me chopsticks once. You guys, I don't know why you sent me chopsticks, but it was really nice. I think we know why she sent you chopsticks. I don't know exactly why. She sent you chopsticks? They're like high end, you know what I mean? With the gold. And a kimono. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And a fan for- And a gong. Yeah. Yeah. I don't understand that. And I go, listen, I love you, dude. And Leanne loves you. And we're like, we're kind of family anyway. I'm just dating. Is it all right? Do I give your blessing? Get your blessing for dating Leanne. No, be real, dude. Look at me right now. Look at my, hey, my bear friend. Look at me, dude. All right. We're bros. Look at me right now. I love, dude, I love, bro, look at me. I love you so fucking much, dude. All right. Do I have your blessing? What would you do? We're face to face. What would I do? Yeah. Yes. I would give you my blessing and then I would start a campaign to ruin your life. I would start slowly with George and Isla. I'd be like, you never call him dad. No. Never. I just started sweating. Here's the deal. Okay. Let's be for real. Yeah. Yeah. If you, if you, if I got a call, they're moving in by the way, if I got a call, kids are moving into my house. Bobby, what are you doing right now? By the way, they don't even live with me. I know exactly. My place is going to be better. Wait and Bert, they get a mastiff. Okay. This is all very, hang on. Now that got really fucking. Yeah. We have a massive too. No, hang on. Oh my God. I'm sweating right now. Is that a belt? Sorry. I think that was our bowl. Mastiff just passed away. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So they just, I know I'm trying to get Leanne to buy a new one. And if Bobby was dating her and then she got a new bowl mastiff, that would be, I would be like, do you ever see the scene from say anything when he's got a boom box? Imagine if he had two guns on the front yard. Yeah. What would you do? They're living. Here's the deal. Your whole family. If you said, if I got a call from the store, this is how let's, let's make the scenario different. Okay. I got a call from the store and they're like, the comedy store. Yes. And they're like, Hey, Leanne's here. And I'm on my way there. And I'm like, what? And they're like, Leanne's here. And we want to give you a heads up. We know you have like a, you're doing Tripoli show tonight and you're in the OR at 10 10. But she showed up and I go, why the fuck is she there? Tell her to leave. They're like, we can't. She's dating a regular. Oh, this is fun. This is fun. Yeah. And I said, who is it? And they said, who do you want it not to be? Okay. Okay. Here we go. There's no way I'd be number one. You're not number one. I can name you 30 people that you, you're not number one. Yeah. Yeah. Who not to be. Yeah. But is he top 10? I don't think I'm even top 10, dude. You wouldn't even think of it. You wouldn't even think of it. If they said it's Bobby, I'd go, thank God. Yeah. I'd say thank God. Cause I think I could, yes, you can. I think I could stomach her with Bobby way more than like, if they're like, it's Marin, I'd be like, what the fucking shit. Yeah. It's, there's, I can name a list. She's holding hands with Jessel Nick. I'd be like, hang on. Stop, stop right there. Okay. And I like, I like these guys. I like these guys. I just, I'm not dealing. What if she went fortune like fortune. That'd be cool. So fucking you fortune. Yeah. Even Whitney. I'd be like, no, that can't have that. Oh no. Oh my God. That's so much fucking drama in my life. But me and fortune. Okay. You and fortune. Yeah. Jeff, die, Mark Marin, uh, Anthony, Jessel Nick, grad Williams. Oh, I'd be, I'd let her date back. Yeah. Adam Ray, Adam Ray. I start, I pull out a fucking gun. Really? Oh, you know, heartbeat. Are you kidding me? Jeremiah Watkins. Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, it would bother me. Yeah. It would bother me on so many levels. Me too. Yeah. I'd be like, hold on. What the fuck? Yeah. Brian Monarch. That's a deep cut. I'd be like, well, he's persistent. Yeah. That's a joke. Only it's kind of, I know that's a really good joke. Yeah. Yeah. He's persistent. I understand how he got in her pants. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like why he just, he called you, he texted you every Monday. Yeah. It's like, I'm sorry. I would never do that. Dang cook. Oh my God. I know. Livid. Yeah. Is that number one? Do you think? No. Oh, no. One would be black. Obviously. Yeah. JJ Walker. JJ Walker. Uh, Donnell Rollins. That'd be fun though. So funny. Yeah. You'll never see her again. Do you know how, you know, Donnell would never let you live it down. Oh, that's right. Like it would, it would never be like, we're cool. Right? He'd be like, you know, what I'm doing, right? Like Donnell would never, I couldn't, uh, write it on the wall, the store. No, I say that because I think that, um, obviously, come on, I would never, but, um, actually now that we start doing the list, you're in the acceptable group. I know that you and Brad Williams. What a group. Why am I in that group? Why am I in that group? You're the one that started this. I'm asking you right now. Why the fuck am I in that group? You started this. Yeah. But why a dwarf and a lesbian? Why am I in it? You know why. No, why cat? No, why, why would I be in that group? Cause you're a dwarf lesbian. Oh, you're the Venn diagram with them both. You're the combo deal. Yeah. Yeah. You're a fishing. I'm the third option. Okay. If you want both, you can, I'll be Lee. Do you like Brad Williams? You don't have the game to get fortune. I would love it. She did. Because she's so great. I could, I, nothing would change in our relationship. I just started hanging out with fortune. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, only you, I think you and I should start one, but you know what we blur, this is how we make our money. We blew up, blur all the privates and they have to pay to get the full. That's called only fans. Tommy. You can't describe a successful business. It's just like Instagram, but you see more. Yeah. Yeah. I got a great idea. Why don't we blur the pictures, put the blurred ones on Instagram. No, I'll tell you why I said that because I've been on only fans. Sometimes they show the whole thing up front. That's poor strategy. Here's the deal. I take so many good semi-naked pictures that I want to post them. Yeah. And I don't. Yeah. I do some, some I do. Do you just hang out in your phone? Do you have a hidden folder? No, I don't know how to do that. I'll show you a picture. I want to post so bad. Yeah. Wait. So I have a friend who is, who has a platform called hidden. That's not like only fans where they only, you can pay people can pay to access your hidden folder. That I like. Wow. Also, if you make a folder, don't call it private because I had a girl go through my phone. She goes, what's private? And she clicked on it. You called it private. Privates. Oh, that's so good, dude. That's a great picture. Yeah. Yeah. But that's not full penis. No, it's not. That's a good one. That's tasteful. I mean, it's more like artistic. Yeah. It's artistic. Yeah. I got it from two angles. You should do a calendar. This one's higher up. Leanne took it. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. I want to post it so bad. You look like you've passed away though. I know. Yeah. That's why I want to be found in a hotel. Yeah. Um, no. What's the facial expression? Are your eyes closed on that one? I think I'm so fat at that moment. Like not that I'm not so fat right now, but at that moment we were in Hawaii and I was on a bender. Breakfast buffet every day. The Four Seasons Breakfast Buffet. What island? Is on Oahu. Is the best breakfast buffet I've ever had in my life. Every day. Every day. And I can't, I mean, I'm like, I start mishmashing where I go in and I get the frittata and then I scoop the eggs off the top of the Benedict and I make a eggs Benedict frittata. Like my mouth's watering. I do bowls of pancakes. Like I take the pancakes, put them in a bowl, put butter, pancake, butter, pancake, and then fill the syrup up like soup and then just mash it all up. Jesus Christ. Can I ask you about the layer of the butter pancake butter pancake? Why can't you put the butter, the butter just on one layer? I'll tell you why though. Right. You asked me a question so you can answer it. No, because I knew you were going to disagree. So forget it then. No, no, I'm dying to know why I can't do it. No, but no, cause I'm asking cause I'm confused by it. Okay, go ahead. If I have a play stack, if I have a stack of three, okay, right. I just put one thick layer in between the top one and the second one. So don't shake your head before I stop. Let me finish what I'm saying. I'm done. Okay. Shake your head. No. So I do one thick layer because I do, I'll eat all three at one time. But what about the bottom pancake, the dryer bottom? It doesn't have, I'm just saying the, but the butter is in between the one and two. I still get it in my mouth. But what about the three? I need, I need, I need all of them to be equally buttered and all of them to have equal much as saturation of syrup. Absolutely. I need, I want, oh my God, the best pancakes in the world I've ever had. I wasn't a pancake guy my entire life. What's the name of the place? Is it called the griddle on sunset? Oh yeah. I love the griddle. I was just there. Classic. Classic. It's the best pancakes I've ever had in my entire life. As a matter of fact, I would go to France and learn how to make croissants, crepes, you're not going to paint. I would love to be able to do that. No, no shit. Yeah. Yeah. I have a fucking tour. I'm starting up in fucking a month, a week. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. Look at that. So Ramsey and I were on the road and we, oh, you were there and you too. And we decided to go to IHOP and taste every pancake they have. I love that energy. I love that. Not enough people live their life like that. I love it. Yeah. That's after a show. I would get the Oreo. Has anyone had the Oreo pancakes? Oh fuck yeah. The cookies and cream. Of course. Yeah. But the best one was the banana luce. Oh. Banana luce buddy. Foster's. Foster's banana luce buddy. This is, yeah. It breaks my heart that not everyone sees this and goes, hey, we should do this Saturday. I know. This is something everyone should do. I've never, I want to do this with you. Where? What? Anytime. I'll do anything. Yeah. Let's do something we don't often try. We talk about this on this pod. You and I have done this pod so many times and we've planned things. We've never done it. Marathon, triathlon, all these. Wait, I'm still in by the way. You're never going to do it with us. I've been waiting for you guys. Yeah. We're all talk, no action. We are a lot of talk. Yeah. Yeah. We are. Because we have careers. Yeah. We're mostly talk. Yeah. But you're some action. I am very much action. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like I like to talk. I like to make bets with people and go, because I like having a goal. Like when I did the bench press competition, I loved to know that I was having a competition to, that if I, every time I worked out, I had something I was aiming for. That I knew if I did the workout perfectly and I pushed myself as hard as I could, that I would achieve my goal. That's why I'm watching the Canelo and Alvarez. Crawford. Crawford. I'm watching the pre-show on Netflix and I was in the gym today and I looked at it and they were working out and I was working out and I was like, well no wonder you're working out as hard as you are. You're fighting for your life. How cool would working out be if you knew that in December you'd fight for your life? Like you go, Bobby, I'm taking you up against a guy your size and we're going to see who can beat the shit out of the other person. Working out would be so easy. Like when you're a football player, you work out because you're fighting another man every week. You never phone it in because you're like, that's what I think our working out needs is. We need like everyone. You and I have to schedule a fight then. I can never fight you. You think you'd defeat me? He can scraft. Bobby? I would love for you guys to actually put head gear on and do. You could actually defeat me you think? Are you being serious? Yeah. You guys can scrap for real. Here's my prayer. By the way, I'm not putting anything past Bobby. He just out held his breath because I panicked looking at him. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I have, Burt has done like a marathon with no training. So my fear is that he can do five rounds. Even if he loses the first second, he will outstamina Bobby. Yeah, but here's the thing. I have no feeling in my body. Kaila, you're missing out on my benefits. Right? And what I've got. That's right. You have diabetic foot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Numbness all over my body. I won't feel a thing. He doesn't feel anything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It's, I mean, I'll just, I don't know. That's like normally. Yeah. I would say to anyone, anyone, I could beat you. I've always said to anyone, I'm going to come to anything. There's something sneaky about Bobby. Yeah. Yeah. What you say? Sneak is amazing. He also feeds off of you not believing in him. So it helps. That's what I feed off of. But if I feed off that and he feeds off of me feeding off of that, we're feeding off the same thing and I'm going to get hungry. Yeah. So at that point it's just, yeah, who's been traumatized more in the childhood. Because that's ultimately what it comes down to is how can you access your trauma and use it for your will. Yeah. The way he does it is he lowers his expectations and makes you lower expectations of him as well. So then you under prepare because you're like, I'm just a little, you know, little man who can't do this. And so you don't prepare as well. And then he is over preparing. You won't train at all. He's studying. I would train like crazy. If you fought me, you wouldn't train. I can get this thing. It's starting right now. This is. I would train like crazy. I would probably train the wrong thing. I'd be like, wait, I didn't know. I didn't know we were using our fingernails. Yeah. Can we do this though? It's not, can we do more jiu jitsu, more like MMA? How about amateur MMA? Let's do MMA so we can do groundwork. There's no way I can catch you. You're like a squirrel. Yeah. I'm like, like there's no way I can catch Bobby. What is, can we just calculate what is the reach advantage for Bert versus Bobby? It's probably 74 inches. Bobby's 64. Yeah. Stick your arm out. All right. Put your hand. Yeah. Like do a fist on my face. Now put your hand out, Bobby. You have a whole foot and a half reach advantage on him. That was, bro, that was crazy. I'll get there. I have a heart. I know, I know. I think you can hit me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. Because you're, you're assuming that your hand is going to be there. Hello. You know what I mean? Your hand's going to be over. Do you know, he'd have to get so close to me to punch me. He could tell me a secret. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because put the fat hit fist back up, right? You're assuming that this is going to happen. Yeah. It's not. It's going to be like this. He's going to slip. You're going to miss. I wonder what a real fight person would say. Like, do we know any boxer boxers? Yeah. Gilbert and Alex. They know. They trained with Freddie Rhodes. Really? Yeah. I saw the wild card boxing and I was like, so wait, what do you think? Both of us have zero training, right? You have never boxed? I've never boxed. Never boxed. If it was just boxing, you would win. Why? It's just the, the weight. I mean, by the way, can you believe that I'm, I am 200 and probably 55 pounds? I benched this morning. I benched 305 three times. I didn't say it, Bobby. And so, no, but, but as you say that, I, I'm still curious where he, what, where would I slip up? You would in the conditioning. Okay. Hold on. I have a feeling you're, you're assuming my condition because of my size, Bobby, right? Well, it's just when you start throwing punches, it's a whole different type of conditioning. Okay. Lifting. It's different than like, it's different than doing like the assault bike. Exactly. Where am I going wrong? Well, I mean, get closer to the mic. Yeah. Alex, where am I going wrong? I don't know if you really have like technique and stuff like that, but that's the, that's the crazy part. But, but the whole thing, it, I agree with Kalyla. If it, it's like, let me talk. All right. You're saying I don't know traditional technique, right? Yeah. But there's Korean family techniques, right? From the Lee family that you're not aware of. He did do taekwondo for most of his childhood. That's Alex right there. Who you, who you boxing with there? That's a Ricardo Ruvalcaba. He's going to be a world champ. 100%. Okay. But that's a, that's Marvin, Marvin's fighter right there. He was letting me hold mitts for him. But the thing is, I agree with Kalyla after like round two, three, especially if you're missing punches, that's when it gets even more tired. So Bobby, if you can evade, I would just work on like head movement, getting out of the way. Oh dude. And after you start like missing, you have no idea. What about, if Bert lands on you, it's a whole different story. It is different. I say like, what do you mean? What story? You have to just be a defensive fighter. Just pepper, pepper, pepper. You can never knock out Bert. That's what he say. You can never knock him out. Right. Um, Alex, sorry. It's impossible for Bobby to knock out Bert. So it's just defensive and then peppering here and there. It's not impossible. You need a stool and a blind. Yeah. If Bert, if Bert, and a gun. Like pinata style. If you got extremely tired, Bobby was so fresh, you started missing and Bobby hits you right. He could still probably rock his shit a little bit. Okay. Let's. So Bert, you would need to conserve your energy too, right? In all of it. Like you couldn't just go out swinging. Okay. I probably, I probably only cause I took fight training. I probably get them on like footwork. Oh, what about MMA? Can we do MMA or no? No, no, no. No. I, that's where I'd say that's my strength. I know it's a coin. That's a coin toss. Yeah. That's my strength. I think any one of it would come down to Bert getting tired and Bert not laying. Wait, wait, wait. Why? Why is I'll go down to not my skill doing weight classes for a reason. Oh, they're weight classes. Oh, and I lost a lot of weight. If Bert's in shape. Right. And I lost a lot of weight. What's the weight difference right now? I'm at 155. I'm probably one, I'm probably one 70. What are you at? What are you at? A lead one. Easily. I'm at like 150, 155. What are you at? Easily 255. Oh yeah. So you're a hundred pounds. That's a big difference. Yeah. Yeah. That's a big difference. That's a big difference. Yeah. All I'd have to do is what could I do? Like stuff that like where I'd like lock him up and then lean on him. That's what I mean. What about this? He's his right. He, his right hand is tied. No, I can't use my left hand. Yeah. Yeah. You have to use your left hand. Oh my God. Bobby, if you guys locked up and he leaned on you, your knees would crumble underneath you. I'm saying, Bobby, you haven't really been working out. This is so fun. Usually I'm the delusional one in this conversation. You're this close. Yeah. I'm trying to help. I know. I understand that. But if his right hand was tied behind his back, I think I could be. What about my left hand? I think I, I think I'd be better off with my left hand. It's a lot. If it's tied up, it's pretty hard to throw a punch. It's not as easy as this. Oh, so if, if his left hand is tied up, it'd be easier for you. This is Bird and Bobby. Yeah. Yeah. The size difference. Can we do this? Can we do this? Can we do this? Can we do this? Me and Drew Lynch fight you. So who's short? Who's small? Who's a comic? You and Brad Williams. No, Brad's not going to do shit. Brad's heavy as shit. He's not going to do shit though. He's going to do ankle work. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Anyway, that's fucking hilarious. Yeah. That would be the difference. How many do you, okay. Do you think you could beat either of the women at this table in a boxing match? Oh yeah. I'll destroy them. What the heck? Yeah. Yeah. You think so? I'm stronger than you think I am. Oh yeah. But how about if we're stronger than you think? No, I, no, no, no. Cat, cat, cat. So I've wrestled him and I've like, we've um, sparred and uh, his strength is like crazy. For real? Yeah. Like maybe I might get him and like accidentally. Fuck you, dude. I said it. I forgot he was at the table. And I went, for real? And then I looked at you and went, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Dude, I was on the wrestling team in high school. I was good. Oh cool. I can grapple. Yeah. And you're also like, Alex, why do you doubt me, dude? He's like strangely like coordinated, like his proprioception, like where his body is. All proprioception. Yeah. Like he knows where his body is at all times. Like sometimes when I'm like spun around or I'm on my back, like I kind of get lost and he is really good at that. Like a compass. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, I love that I think he just heard that compliment for the first time. He goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm like a compass. I don't even know where the fuck I am. Exactly where I am at all times. I know north, south, west, east. I can't tell if this is your flosser or mine. Oh no. Yeah, yeah. Do you guys have floss? We don't have floss like that. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Helix guys. I have three rooms in my bedrooms and I have three bedrooms and I have a helix mattresses in all my bedrooms because if I have company over and people want to relax at my house or go to sleep or take a nap, I want them to have the best human experience possible.

You don't want them to have back pain. You don't want them to have motion transfer because you're a guy who like moves a lot. I like stagnant. You like static. I don't want motion. I don't want motion. I don't want motion. Yeah. I mean, and I want your company to get lower back arthritis. Exactly. That's basically what I'm saying too. You also snoring, back pain, sleep apnea, sleeping through the night, sleeping too hot. Helix addresses those things. And helix is just an overall upgrade from whatever mattress you already use.

Let's do this. Someone take a picture. Take a picture of our buttholes. I have one on my phone. It's in the private folder. No, no, no. We do it on a random photo and then you guys see each other's buttholes to see if you can guess it. Okay. Hang on. Alex used the high quality photo? Yeah. All right. So Alex. All right. So I'm going to go in the green. Can you take a photo of the booth or no? Yeah, in the booth. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If I go to my maps, Asia. So cute. If I go to my maps. If I take a photo of my butthole and you don't do it, it's a fucking foolish on me. Wait. Yeah. I'm not taking a picture of it now. I already have one. He already has one. Oh, I'm just doing one then. Yeah. I have one of yours too. If you just wanted. We all have one in here. On flash, please. Sorry. Sorry. Well lit. Alex, vlog this. Good lighting. It's what's happening back there. His camera's too high. It's showing things I've never seen before. Yeah. Yeah. It's showing. I think it's so bad. Yeah. You gotta use your iPhone. It's so bad. Alex, send me that photo. Do you want mine shaved or with hair? The only picture I can find is with shaved. Like right after I shaved it. I say do you say? I shaved because. Oh, God. Dude, get that. Hey, guys. Guys. I'm downloading pictures of Bobby. I'll see the internet and show Bobby. OK. I'm going to get a black butthole. Wait. Can you send me the photo so I can throw it up on the spot? Let's choose one. Find one. Oh, my God. Something happened. Something happened to my asshole. Something bad happened to my asshole. Oh, my God. You're going to know the difference. Oh, my God. No. You're going to know the difference. Oh, my God. Wow. Can you send me the photos so I can put up? Yeah. It's going to be super close though. So he thought Alex was going to give you the rundown. Burt just sent me his photo. Oh, OK. Did you get it? Yeah. I got it. All right. So he thought. Something happened. Because you see my. Years ago, you saw my butthole, right? Send me the photo. We'll guess. OK. Yeah. Oh, my God. What happened? What happened? Black hands asked you. Oh, yeah. It's so black. I can take an aerodrome. Oh, my God. Wait. What do you mean? I think it died. What happened, Beth? I think it died. I think it died. Because I have a picture to compare it to. I understand that. You have that old photo? Yeah, I think so. Maybe use that one. OK. This one's way too dark. God damn it. Why are you not close, Clyde? All right. You got to go really to the anal cavity. Yeah, I think that we should zoom in. Yeah. To where the ring of fire is. So much toilet paper. Burt, are you still strolling, Burt? Are you? Come on, dude. There's so much toilet paper. I got to wipe my butthole, dude. What am I looking for? You can't wipe. You're not going to air it, right? No. No. I want to see it. Are you ready, Burt? Have Kat guess, because I already know which is which. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, Kat, are you OK? I think so. I don't know. All right. I'm going to put them side by side, right? All right. All right. No one laugh. No one say anything. Zoom. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Before you air it, we'll do this. And hang on. And no making fun of each other's buttholes. All right. OK, so here's what it is. Only positive critique. All right, so here's the thing. Positive critique. Right before, let me just say something. No one even smile. This is a scientific research. OK. We're doing, right? We're scientists. Yeah. Don't even smile. If you smile, dude, you get kicked out of the room. Got it. OK. Don't look at me like that. All right. You don't smile. I'm not smiling. All right. All right, hold on. Here we go. Let me just get this. Kat, get your shit together. OK. You got this, Kat. I believe in you. I will kick you out of my house. OK, I know. OK. Kat, I believe in you. All right, here we go. I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm being real close. OK. OK. What is going on? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Which one is Bert and which one is Bobby? It's too close. It's too close. What am I looking at? It's so close. It's so close. It's like we've been in a car accident. And they were doing a fucking on all fours of the front seat. It's too close. It's too close. Can you zoom out? Do another thing. Zoom out a little bit, dude. What if it reveals, though? Oh, the reveals. OK, here. I'll go here. I'll go look for it. I don't even know. I got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Bobby's. I know it. Yeah. Bobby's. It has to be Bobby's. Bobby! Dude, I got to. That bottle on the right looks like someone just put something inside it. It looks like when your maid does your shit inside. Oh my god, dude. Oh my god. OK, now zoom out for the reveal. Zoom over for the reveal, dude. All right. We know the reveal. That's Bert. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's Bobby. Which one is Bert? Which one is Bobby? Yeah. So left side is Bert. Yeah. That's Bobby. Bobby's got. Yeah, yeah. That's right. That's right. You're wrong, cat. That's the wrong cat. Whoa! I'm taking these off. I was wrong. I was wrong. We deserve to podcast for the rest of our lives. This is the greatest medium that's ever been invented. This is the best thing I've ever done in my life. Let me see Bobby's anal vagina again. You thought Bobby's was your asshole. You got it wrong. Oh my god. This might be the best game to be ever played. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. The stretching. That was really what was on. Really sold it. Yeah. Yeah. That was so extreme. Yeah, yours is worse. Is that yours? It's poo. It's poo. You poo. You're in my camera. You poo juice. No, that's yours, Bobby. Sorry, that was from Alex's camera. That was from the high definition camera. Delete those photos. Oh my god. Permission to party world tour starts September 18th in Rockford, Illinois on a birdbirdbird.com. Bobby, that is the best. Oh my god. That was crazy, dude. Look at the poo. Look at the little poo trail. There's a little poo juice in there. Oh, Bobby. Oh, fuck. I thought it was the lens. I thought it was the camera lens. It was a flare. A J.J. Abrams flare. A J.J. Abrams flare. It was a yellow flare. Oh. My stomach. Oh my god. Oh, shit, dude. Oh my god. Holy shit. OK. Let's reset. Reset. I can't breathe. Yeah. I have to interview Willie Nelson's son after this. How am I going to do that? Crack your butthole? Did we see your butthole? I thought we only saw Bobby's butthole. Yeah, we didn't even see. We got a lot of Bobby buttholes. We got a lot of Bobby buttholes. Yeah, why is mine so dark around that? I'm actually kind of shocked. We have to call a dermatologist or something. Yeah, I don't know why. Wait, this is Bobby's or Bert's? That's Bert's. Why is it so black? This looks so black. What? That's an African butthole. It's a dye. Your poo dyed your butthole. Why is it so dark? Bert, explain yourself. It's like a brunette. Dude, why is it like that, dude? I don't like it. It's like a roast beef. It's really dark down there. Yeah, why is it so dark? It's called a soul hole. Wait, Bert, we can't even rewind. Didn't you say that it looks like someone just entered it? Because you thought it was Bobby's? You said that about your own butthole. Oh, Jesus, why is it so dark to be honest, dude? Because it's not mine. It's a black person's butthole. He sent me a black person's butthole. He didn't even do it. He made you do it. I started panicking and I couldn't find my butthole. And I just was like, I need a butthole quick. Those aren't your fingers, dude. God damn it, those aren't your fingers. Oh, that's not even fair, dude. Oh my God. You're not supposed to laugh this hard. Oh my God. So you don't have a photo of your butthole. I couldn't find it and I started panicking. For whatever reason, every time I go to my map, on my pictures, the first thing I see is my butthole. And I'm always like, God damn it, why did I take a picture of my butthole? But then you were so quick at it and I was like, I couldn't find my butthole. You don't have to. That was funnier. I literally thought it was yours. That was so funny. It could be though, that's the crazy thing. I swear to God, every time I go on here, I see my butthole. Kat, you were here when he said, I'm going to send a black person's butthole. I was traumatized. You tricked me? No, I didn't remember. Oh, so you guys knew it was a black person's butthole? He said it to me. I saw your little poo trail and everything before that disappeared. I can't imagine where I would have taken a picture of my butthole. Just ask Lian. I don't need to see it. Yeah, yeah. I've already seen it in your butthole. You know that, right? Well, you don't have hemorrhoids. That's good news. That black guy doesn't either. Zero. It's a little dark. I don't know what's going on there. Is it that dark? I don't think it's that type of dark. Because my skin is yellow. But the region around it is so black and dark. It just doesn't see light. No, that's not how that works. Are you sure? It's a recent development is why we're concerned. Yeah, because she's seen it regular. It is pretty dark. It looks kind of like a dark patch. I wonder if it's because... Massive weight loss? Massive weight loss and it's just extra skin and it all started cinching at your butthole. Because it is very symmetrical, so I'm not that worried. It looks like a uniform. It looks like a vagina when you spread it open. Type in Asian buttholes and let's see if you see other people's buttholes. I'm not sure. I don't know. I'll try to get it. Type in Asian buttholes and let's see if you see other ones like that. You're never going to see that. Have you seen Druski do white face? So good. I wanted to do white face for a long time. How about this? Could you do red face? Do Andrew like an Andrew. And then can you do an Irish accent? No. Hello. No. I don't know. It's so good. It's so good. Redneck's the easiest accent to pull off though. It is. Black guy and redneck are the two easiest ones. Andrew, I asked him if he wanted to do Asian face. He said it will ruin his career. Would you do Asian face? I could do it and no one would ever know it was me. That's the gamble. The gamble is do it and then never tell anyone. So it's just kind of like for yourself. I'm not sure. I said to Tom, if I was with Asians who had no connection with their culture. We know. I could get in. We wouldn't know. For real? That's a good question. Asian people just talk like regular people. There's no accent. There's no accent. I'm not saying we go to a Korean barbecue restaurant and we all have to order. I'm just saying if you're a Korean, you have to order. I'm not saying you have to order. I'm just saying if you're a Korean, you have to order. I'm not saying you have to order. I'm just saying if you're a Korean, you have to order. I'm not saying you have to order. If I go to a Korean barbecue restaurant and we all have to order, I get caught. I think. If I went to the Philippines, I'd get caught. There's a lot of things you could use. You could use face tape. You could change the color of your eyes. I think the body type would be a little bit different. That's the only thing. You'd have to sumo style. The bet I made with Tom is I think I could go to Ireland. And do Irish face. Get pale as fuck. And then just go into a bar and be like, hello, mighty! Or whatever. That's more English. But what could you do? Could you do Japanese face? He's doing it already. I don't think so. Could I look like a Filipino, you think? I think so. My eyes would have gotten rounder though. There's so many kinds of Filipinos you'd still pass if you did it right. Really? You could do it on the mustache. I think the skin is too light though. Can I pass as Filipino now? If I got really dark? Maybe, yeah. Because the Filipino, again, it's light, dark. There's so much in between. Could you pass as Korean? What about just mixed? Oh, interesting. That's not full blackface. That's half blackface. That's the white guy that turned Asian. Oh, that's right. You did it great. It is pretty good. The eyes, how did he do that? With the eyes there. I think it's surgery. It has to be. It's so strange. Back in my day, white people didn't even like us and now they want to look like us. No, I don't think we didn't like you. I think we didn't know you. I think it's just representation. I didn't know any Asian people growing up. And then when I started meeting Asian people, I was like, this is fucking awesome. That's like Kristen Wiig. That right way looks like Kristen. When's the first time you saw an Asian? First grade, Sam Ho. Sam and Ron DeHo. And then I got Asian traumatized because Sam Ho in third grade threw up in his lunchbox. And I was like, fuck it, I don't fuck with Asian food. I don't know whatever he ate. It always smelled a little off. And then he threw up in his lunchbox. I was like, I'm out. And then I probably saw my first... I'm trying to be as real as possible. In college, we had a guy named Ron who was Asian. An off-turnity. I didn't know anything about... I wrote a joke about it when I first moved out to LA. I did not know that Japanese people could not understand Chinese people. I thought it was the same. Like Boston and New York. Like, hey, back ahead. Go fuck yourself. And then I think when I came out to LA is when it kind of blossomed for me. Because we became friends with Roy Joy. Oh, I see. And Roy was just like... I have no idea what they're saying. I'm going to take a photo of me in high school and my friend group. And you're going to be like, oh, I was pretty much white. Can I send this to you? I'm going to send this to Gilbert. Florida was very, for lack of a better word, segregated. I knew one, two Indian kids that were related. I knew two Asian people, Ron and Sam. That was it. A ton of Cuban, ton of Puerto Rican, ton of black. But like, nothing of diverse. Indian, Pakistani, never. Like, nothing. Where in Florida was it? Tampa. But it's also generational. You got to remember, I'm older than you guys. I'm 52. So we're talking in the 70s. Not like it is now. Sorry, sorry, sorry. What is that? That's his friend group. So that's me in high school. So pretty much I was white. Oh, you look Filipino there. I'm not Pervis, Megan Hewitt, Craig Crawford, Alan Meadows. And me. I have my Depeche Mode. So cute. But that's how I grew up. Hey, were you as unique as you are today then? Or were you kind of more assimilated? I would do weird things where they would go, why did you do that? Weird things? Look at your jawline. Go back. I don't like his popping. You can't see the jawline in that one. Look at that. Kind of glowy. I think I was pretty handsome. I think Leanne has always thought Bobby is attractive. Even Pudgy Bobby. You are a very attractive dude. I don't know what happened. But something happened. My face is not that anymore. No, I think you're just skinny there and you're getting skinny again. I think it will show back up. I actually think as you got older you got hotter. Really? Because you're very round and young. I don't know. Look at the dress though. It's pretty good. Woman? Next to University of Colorado? Yeah, that's Megan Hewitt. She was my best buddy. It's me in high school. That Filipino? Did she have a grill in? So mean. Pull up the jewelry store and buy me a grill. What? Your tie is so cool. Bolo tie. This could be modern day Silver Lake. Very. So anyway, as a kid. You want to see me when I was younger? In college? Go to Barstool FSU Instagram. There's a picture I just saw myself. I was like, god damn it, what did I do? Good or bad? I was so much better looking when I was younger. You think so? I could fuck more chicks now. If I wanted to, I could just tear up pussy. I have money. Is that hard? You're married? No, not at all. Scroll. Where was it? This is Barstool FSU. That's it. Maybe I was wrong. Go to that one. The old school pictures. Go to that. Go back. Can you find me? You're in this photo? Are you the left guy? Right here? Hold on. You're the guy to the left. Holy shit, that is you. You look like Court McCowen a little bit. Thank you so much. You were pretty hot then. Skinny and hot. You want to see me skinny? Type in Skinny Burt Kreischer. That's so cool that you could do that. There's one picture that was when I met Leanne. This is what Leanne married. If you type in Skinny Burt Kreischer. Where were you in this picture? At a beach week. Wow. That's what Leanne met. That's what she met. Bait and switch. How long did it take you to go from the regular to this? To this? I've been working on it for a while. It's funny. This looks good. This is older. That's pretty good. That's me the other week. You fluctuate. That was when I was last on tour before I shot my special. That's unsustainable. The one on the right? The one on the right is just like... What are you eating? Just steaks. I only had steaks and I worked out like crazy. That's not bad. This is pretty more. That's right before I went on the full eliticus. More importantly, look at my dick. Look at my dick print. It looks bigger. That's really good. Your balls are huge. Not anymore. Me and a bunch of comics at the Comedy Store one night were talking about other headliners and stuff. You're voted the most, not just the nicest, but the comic that have helped more comics than anybody else. For real? You've helped so many of us. Young hotties. Because of your fully unloaded tour and you're so generous in inviting people into doing things with you. It really uplifts people and makes people feel like a part of something. You're just really good at that. Tom's good at that too. Everyone does it in their own way. I think more people do it silently. I do it a little more out loud because I do events. In doing the event, I try to bring as many people. I've had a lot of people say very nice things to me like that. As people have gotten really successful, I've had them pull me aside at different moments and go, just so you know, thanks for taking me on the road. I did it selfishly. If I'm with you and Tom ever brings you anywhere, it's because it's selfish because we like you. I say more than like you. I was talking to Guy Fieri the other day. He had done his show with you and Andrew. He said, you know what, I only knew Bobby through you. He was like, but Bobby is wild. He goes, I just met Bobby at that show when we did the Super Bowl together. It's so funny to go, but I think it's cool to introduce people. Someone said this about me, but it's the truth. I love introducing people to people. I love connecting people. I love going, hey, have you met my friend? I think it's a fault sometimes because not a lot of people know Joe. Sometimes I'll be like, hey, have you met Joe? They'll be like, yeah, I know him. I'm like, okay, just checking. Who's Joe? Joe List. The most famous Joe there is. No, Joe Rogan. I love Joe List. I'm going to get a bunch of shit because I mentioned Joe List. It's so funny. I love introducing people. I love that energy. I love that Super Bowl weekend where it was me, you, Tom, Shane Gillis, and Trevor Wallace. Who hit the winning field goal? I did. That's why you never count out Bobby. From the beginning, let's go back from the beginning. The holding the breath stuff. You doubted me. Kicking the field goal. You doubted me because I was the last person to be picked on the team. I've got to be dead honest with you. I didn't doubt you. I completely didn't think you'd do it. I thought there's no way in hell. You completely shocked the world. My point is why? Because I'm athletic. I played tennis. I was on the wrestling team. I'm coordinated. I have the eye of the tiger as some say. I think it's a lot of mental. I think for you it's very mentally fit. What do you mean? Mentally fit. You're good with games in there. Strategy. In and out. You don't see me. This is the one I posted. They say 25% of the people can hold their breath. You guys want to try it one more time? No. Between the both of you. You too. We're going to restart. Here we go. Get ready. Don't cheat. Bobby didn't do it. It's going to bounce two times. Ready, get set, go. 25%. Once they locked in we are at 50%. This is where we see who falls out right now. Stay locked in everyone. Great job. Claude is not phased. Kat I feel like you're cheating but it's okay. One person out. Everyone stay locked in. We are at 70%. There's no way. 70% of what? We hit 100%. We're good then. We're still going but there's no... Claude would have kept going. Back around to 25%. Good Claude. Thank you. I'm going to piss my pants off. That's fucking crazy. As a kid those underwater games where we could hold each other underwater. I would stay there for days. Days. Just days. I would say you probably have better lung capacity than me on land. Not in water. I think in water too. When we're moving. I can't move. The way you really hold your breath is by like hold your breath and then do a farmer's carry and walk weights across the thing and then back or swim. It's easier when you watch people do breath holds. They lay in the pool and being calm and everything is fine. But to dive down and then to sit and then to wait and then hunt a fish and then kill the fish, catch it and swim up. It's too much. I feel like that's... But again when I do it it's really all in the head. If I even have a negative thought that enters of like my own breath, losing my breath. Then I'm like, I'm going to go to the pool. If I have a negative thought that enters of like my own breath, losing my breath. Then I have to surface immediately. But if I stay calm, if I stay locked in, there's the fish. And I'm like staying in the moment. It's so chill. But it's all in the head. Like your head gets in the way of everything. Like when I play this thing I refuse to lose. I'd rather die. Yeah. I guess theoretically you can say to yourself, look at that. Who's that? That's Bobby. Yeah, it's me. He's playing the game literally in Hawaii. Against my sister who's also a diver. And he did not win. Why do you have to do it that way? It's so scary. It's so dramatic. Relax, relax. Is that at Turtle Bay? No, that's at Four Seasons. Honolulu. That's the adults only pool. There he surfaced and she's still down. But still, okay. Dr. Mai ties us right over there. Is that your favorite island? Yeah. Because it's the most accessible. There's the most shit to do. I think Maui is pretty fucking cool. But it's like, I don't know. I mean to get over. I mean it's not as much shit to do in Maui as there is there. And then Lanai and Kauai are kind of like, they're almost like going to a small town. And so I like that because there's like, I always go, I probably just brought my family. Like my mom, my dad, my sisters. I'm like, I'm going to go to Hawaii. I'm going to go to Hawaii. I'm going to go to Hawaii. I brought my dad, my sisters, their kids, my wife's family. I brought everyone because I was like, everyone's alive. It's a lot of money. But you know what? No one will ever forget this. It will be a fucking blast. No one doesn't love Hawaii. Everyone loves Hawaii. And my dad was like so emotional. He was like, buddy, we could have never afforded to do this. With this many people. And he was like, this is like a memory we're always going to have. And my niece and nephew were there. It was fucking awesome. And everyone looks at Hawaii and they're like, look around. This is the greatest place in the world. Because also we know where to eat. We know all the spots. The Acai spots. You know all the trails and all the swimming spots. Every time I'll call Kalani, where do I go? She'll tell me where to go. Where's the hurricane right now is passing right north of it. It went down in category. It did? But I kind of wanted it to stay big. And go north of it. Because I was like, the north shore will be crazy. With the waves? Yeah, but with the winds it's like chop, chop, chop. I can't have, first of all I never read Acai as Acai. I read Acacia. I do that with everything. My dyslexia the other day, it said helping veterans. And I thought it said piping veterans. And I was like, ooo. I want to see that website. I don't think Acai is that good for you. I think it's a lot of sugar. I think it's a lot of sugar. I don't think it's a lot of hype. The Cove doesn't add sugar to their Acai. What is Acai supposed to fucking do? I don't know, it's antioxidants. But there's other antioxidants, right? But it tastes delicious. It does taste delicious. But Acai is a Brazilian thing. What do you put in your Acai, Bert? I won't have it. That makes me sick. Every time I eat it, it gives me like crazy heartburn. That and pomegranate. The second I have it, I'm like, eugh. I don't like fruit. I'm not a fruit guy. You'll never see me eating a banana. It's like, come on. We can eat a banana. What? Ever? You have a banana? I carry bananas everywhere. Eat a banana. It is so unrewarding for that many calories. You probably don't even do peanut butter, huh? I love peanut butter. I love peanut butter. If I'm going to date with a girl and she goes, I don't like peanut butter, I just drop her off right in the street. Get out of the car right now. I don't like peanut butter. That's right. That was the thing that drove me crazy about you. I eat it, but I don't hate it. I just don't add it onto things. I dated a chick one time, and the first night we went to a place to look up, I was made out with her, and she smelled like baloney sandwiches. Eww. That's a plus. I love that. It was weird, because I was like, wow, I haven't had baloney. Her mouth or her body? Everything about her smelled like baloney. I guess she had a baloney sandwich. For lunch. I haven't had baloney in forever, but I don't search out baloney, but I did like baloney with a lot of mayonnaise. On white bread. I was like, oh, whatever. Maybe it's just one sandwich. The next night we go back to her place, and she smells like baloney again. I go, this bitch loves baloney. The next day I wake up at her place, and she's like, are you hungry? I was like, yeah, I'll take a baloney sandwich. She's like, I don't have baloney. I was like, oh, you smell like baloney? Oh, wow. I'm like, I don't have baloney. Oh, wow. She just said deli meats. I dated her for two years. And then you just start getting used to baloney smell. Wow, you get used to it. I feel like baloney has really gotten a bad rap. Isn't it very similar to mortadella? It is mortadella, basically. It is, right? I think any sandwich meat, if I smell them on a woman, I don't like it. Hold on. No, no, no, no, no. If you go to make out with a girl, and she smells like an Italian sandwich, I'm like, oh, I don't have any. She smells like an Italian sandwich, all there forever. Or how about like honey baked ham? No. That could be nice. I want to say something about you and your generation of comics. Can I say something? You guys all smell musky. Oh, that's because we use musky stuff on it. It's more like musky. Okay, that's not what it is. That's not what it is. I don't think that's what it is. Can I just say something? No, no, no. You're just masking a smell. A lot. Hold on. I love where this is going. This is unfair, by the way. You're being unfair. You don't have the gene for body odor, which makes you, you know. Abnorbs. Perfect. I don't have the gene for body odor either. You don't? I've never worn deodorant. I've never worn cologne in my life. Wow. In eighth grade, we did Drecard Noir. Cool water. But as a grown man, I never wore it. My new assistant, Kyle, he douses himself in it. He smells nice. No, no, no, but he doesn't have a ton of money, so he buys cheap cologne. And I told him, no cologne better than cheap colognes. And then the other day, he saw me putting on cologne. And he goes, but you're putting on cologne. I said, first of all, it's nice cologne. It's Tom Ford. But I only wear cologne if I'm going to hang out with a man who wears cologne. I'm going to wear cologne if I'm going to hang out with a man who wears cologne. I'm going to wear cologne if I'm going to hang out with a man who wears cologne. I see. It's an alfamil thing. I've got to bring a smell to it. We don't go into your room, and then you tell me what we're smelling like. I bring my smell in, and now we both smell our thing. I would never do that as a woman. I don't know if I'd be like, oh, I've got to wear perfume because Tiffany's going to be smelling like it. Imagine if I was like, all right, it's going to smell like farts today. And you're like, I don't like farts. And you go, no, it's not. I want to smell it. But you're going to smell it. You're going to smell it. And you're going to smell it. I don't like farts. And you go, well you're gonna hang on me so it smells like farts. You go, well then I'm gonna do something to negate that. I'm with you. You're gonna smell yourself instead of him. I would rather smell me than whatever Sebastian wore. Because we don't trust Sebastian necessarily. Wait, wait, wait. He's the first guy. I made the rules with Sebastian. Wait, wait, wait. We've learned, men, we've learned everything from Sebastian Maniscalco. I'm not talking about Sebastian Maniscalco. I'm just saying random Sebastian. No Sebastian Maniscalco. I thought we were just talking about you. Bert and I get our nails done like Sebastian. Right? By the way, hang on, hang on. I don't think you know that we both have just gotten our nails done. I actually caught you with your nails. Yeah, yeah. Mine aren't actually. Yeah, yeah, you guys are. You guys are doing animal style. You guys are doing animal style. Wow, like yours Bobby. Right? And also we were cologne like Sebastian, okay? Maniscalco, right? And your defense is that you got, it wasn't a bad thing. I wasn't attacking you that you smelled musty. You told me I smell like dust. What did I, wait. Isn't that what musty means? Yeah, what did I say? That would be like this. I go, what are you wearing? Is that dust? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What did I say you smell like dust? I thought that's what musty means, like dusty. No, musty's a, it's like a, it's like a huh. Yeah, it's a huh. It's not like a hey. Yeah, yeah. It's like earthy, earthy. It's earthy. It's earthy. That sounds nice. But you guys smell like. All the doorman and women there at the store smell the same way. Really? Yeah, and I don't like it. But can I say something about all your perfumes and stuff? The reason I stopped wearing them is they're endocrine disruptors. And as women, we cannot fuck up our hormones and things like that. Endocrine disrupts, what's that mean? What does that mean? Endocrine is a hormones. This is like such a basic. That's what I wear. I'm sorry. You don't. I do wear that. I've never smelled that on you. I wear that. Are you wearing that now? No, I'm wearing a different one. It's called bergamot. Can I smell you? Yeah. The bergamot is very, very good. But the Sansil 33 is like, what every. I don't know, maybe I'm not wearing. You just smell like clean hair. Okay, come here. Mine is just my hair care. Pat, let me smell. Ooh, the ebb smell. You just smell clean. You smell like nothing. You smell different today. What the? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, maybe I'm wrong. I went to Sebastian to the forum and I was getting ready and Leanne said, oh, you're putting on a button shirt. I said, well, Sebastian, show. I've never seen you wear a collared shirt out. And I went, but yeah, but Sebastian, so everyone's gonna be dressed up a little nicer. She goes, what kind of clone do you think he'll be wearing? And I panicked. And I went, well, I hope I like it because I'm gonna be with him. And she was like, well, what do you think it is? And I was like, I bet I'm not gonna like it. I was like, you know what? I'm gonna pull it. I only had this one thing, Tom Ford, fuck yeah, or fuck this is delicious or something. And so I used that. I liked the smell. And then I was like, okay, so that's the rule. If you know a guy's gonna be, in my head, if you know a guy's gonna be wearing a clone, then you bring your own scent so you can smell you. Oh, that's great. Sebastian and I crossed paths at the improv where he was right before me and he was coming up the stairs, I was coming down. As we crossed paths, he turned around and goes, what is it? And I told him. My point is that men we know. What did he smell like? Purity. You know what I mean? The heights of life. Beauty. You know what I mean? Extreme goods. No, I loaded up. You loaded it up? Okay. My daughter, I used to have a joke about it. But I mean, this is the truth. This is the way her brain worked. The joke, if you've ever heard, it's one of my specials. She used to keep her deodorant in the refrigerator and I saw her one day and she wiped her finger across it and rubbed it above her lip. Oh yeah. And I go, what the fuck are you doing? She goes, mind your own business. And then I found out there was a kid in her class that smelled like shit. And she was like, dad, I can't trust that he'll wear deodorant, so I wear deodorant for him. And I put it under my nose because I know what I want to smell. Oh. And I was like, wow, that's crazy. Wow. So it's a weird way to look at life. Put it under your nose because that's how bad a kid smells. Yeah. Yeah. Poor kid. Someone's gotta tell him. But there's always a kid that stinks growing up and no one tells him. Do you remember this name? I remember both. I do. I do too. Isn't that crazy? We both, that's, hold on, hold on. Stop for a second. Yeah. Think about all the people that crossed your paths in life. Think of all the times you had a crush on a person and you don't really remember their name a little bit. Remember the kid that fell or got hit by a car when you were young and they passed away and you don't remember them. But we all remember the kid that stunk. Yeah. And you remember his name? Yep. That says something about me. What's his name? Cyrus. What's your name? Timothy. Yeah. Blinky McGiven. Oh, his last name, social security number. Was it a leprechaun? Blinky McGiven. Blinky McGiven. Blinky. Arr, sorry, it's Blinky McGiven. You know, the guy, though, the guy that I remember in my class in fifth grade who would stick all his boogers underneath his desk. And he had just like- That's my favorite guy. A whole, like, it was like stalactites underneath there. But he is a very rich politician back home now. In, oh, Manny Pacquiao. No, no, no. Manny Pacquiao adjacent, but like he turned out, the booger boy turned out to be a very, you know- We had a guy that would eat anything. Go ahead. No, I was gonna say, what's the weirdest thing that you remember and then you're just about to say it? These are the things I remember. There was a guy in our neighborhood that would get naked and climb trees. There was a guy who, there was one guy in high school. Now I'd, I never really said anything. I was never really, I never really attacked him. But he let someone borrow his recorder and they played it. By the way, if I said his name, anyone that went to my high school would know his name immediately. And someone borrowed it and they played the videotape in it and it was him jacking off for his girlfriend. Now we don't think of it as gay, but when I was a kid, that was gay, that you would videotape yourself jacking off and that kid had a rough run of it. Wow. Oh, that sucks. For all the years or just a semester? Oh no, oh no, for the rest of the year. There was a kid in my neighborhood, Armando, and he used to throw avocados at people's heads. I like that. Yeah, yeah, and so there was three guys. It doesn't suck. No, no, I swear to God, dude. There's three guys with scars on their heads from Armando. Oh, unripe, unripe. Yeah, unripe, yeah, they were hard. You just whip them. What? That guy's gonna be a pro. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like Armando. Yeah, yeah, Armando's good. I had a girl in my class who had four fake teeth and she had a retainer that she made out of fake teeth and then she would just take it off. Oh, that's cute. I have a family member, a distant family member, who instead, she had such a big gap between her both front teeth, so instead of getting braces, she just added another tooth in the middle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, makes sense on paper, but when you see it in real life, it's so subtly jarring. That's Tom Cruise. Yeah, Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise had this, do you know the girl, I think, I don't mean the men of Slanders, but I think the young lady from the bear got her teeth fixed. Which one? AO. Oh, her, really? I think there's no longer a gap there, which she looks great, but it kind of bums me out because I kind of liked the gap. Yeah, I love the gap. I do too. Yeah, like in White Lotus season three, you know the teeth. I fucking think she's so beautiful. We love the teeth, I love them. I think there's something so, you know, Leanne used to have a snaggletooth, like one tooth that just shot back in her mouth, and she had a hole right here, a dilated pore, and I fucking loved the flaw in her. I loved the flaw, but then she got them all fixed, and I was like, ugh. The dilated pore? Well, they thought it was cancer, so they had to cut it open. Now, if you look at her closely, she has a huge scar that runs from her nose to her lip. Which is also kind of cool in a movie. Now, everyone thinks I hit her. So you want to talk about your TV show, or no, is that two? No. Okay. Tour, tour. What? It's tour. Your tour, what's up? Oh yeah, I want to start a tour. What? Until next week. Where you going? Party, I'm going everywhere. I'm doing, this is the last time I'll do arenas. I'm going back to theaters in January. Well, I've got a special I got to do, and so I can't- Another one? Yeah, I'm doing another special. Jesus Christ. How many specials do you have? At least one. And so, in order to get ready for it, I can't do one show a night. I have to do two shows a night. Yeah. Wow. Cabin the Cabin on Netflix, I was just talking to someone about how fucking great the cabin was. That was a great show. It was such a great show. Why did they do another one? Because it was during the pandemic. That was a good episode you went on. Your episode was incredible. Your episode was the reason, I don't mean this with disrespect to anyone who made the show, and I know everyone very intimately that made the show, but I watched the first cut of the first episode, and I didn't like it. And I was like, and it was way early. And Leanne and Jeff Tomczyk were doing the notes. Has he ever directed a special of yours, Jeff Tomczyk? Every single one of them. Because Jeff wants to do mine. I love him. He's done every single one of mine. I love Jeff. And he'll do the next one too. Really? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I just worked on a project. I just acted in a project with him that I wasn't the star of. I love Jeff Tomczyk. I love him, okay. But they were doing notes, and I watched the first episode, and I was like, ugh, this is rough. This is gonna be a rough watch. And then I stopped watching them. I stopped watching edits. I go, you guys take care of it. And Leanne and Jeff would go back and forth, and she'd give notes for me and her, and then Jeff would give notes, and we'd work to the editor. And one night, I'm laying in bed. It's gotta be during the pandemic. It is during the pandemic. And I listen to Leanne laughing hysterically. And so I get out of bed, I go, what the fuck are you watching? And she's on an iPad, she goes, I'm watching The Cabin. She goes, Don-El and Bobby is the funniest thing I've ever seen in my entire life. And I go, wait, I wanna see it. She goes, you haven't looked at it? And I was like, no, I'm not watching these fucking things. And they played it. She played it. And I was crying laughing. And I was like, whatever her and Jeff Tomczyk and Matthew and everyone that was involved in it, they worked so hard to get that raw footage so good. We were good too. We were fucking awful. I mean, why would you, I mean, you know what I mean? But the storytelling in it is very different. It's very different. The storytelling. Because we didn't go into The Cabin with any script. We just literally, they were like four setups, and we'll figure it out. And I mean, nothing. Like the beginning episode is me, the beginning of that episode with us is me on that bear getting a painting done. Bobby walks in, immediately gets naked, gets in front of me. Donnell walks in and walks immediately out. And it's so fucking funny. The next thing is the three of us doing. This is, you know, can I tell you, this is before everyone knew about Cold Plunge in sauna. This is before everyone knew about Cold Plunge in sauna. You wouldn't let me in? Okay, yeah. Why is he wearing a hoodie? Donnell was. Yeah. Didn't want to be. He was not into it. This is so good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What a great night. There's one thing I think you said about, like was it your dad? So funny. It was so good. What was it? Really moving. Anyway. This was, but yeah, so I just shot the TV show. That'll be out in January. Good. But I got a new special. So this is the last time I'm gonna do arenas. Cause I gotta do, I gotta double up the show. So I'll go back to theaters from January until I shoot the special. Okay. So I got Red Rocks is October 1st. Indianapolis, Columbus, Yakima. Wow. Yeah. And so I'm excited. I'm excited to get back on the road. That's awesome. Yeah. Awesome. Really excited to get back on the road. Well guys, give Burke Reich a round of applause. Woo! And that was good. Okay.
